    Tab option for the Model tab

The Tab options for the Model tab has been listed below:


1. New Tab – To configure the design for the Value Driver Tree using the
   options such as Sample Demo Tree, Create a Simple Dynamic Tree,
   Import an Advanced Tree and Create a New value driver tree from the
   scratch.

2. Node Tab – To configure the settings of Nodes and Child Nodes for the
   Value Driver Tree

3. Data Series Tab – To configure the data settings such as Data Series Manager, Time Aggregation Labels
   and Data Sorting.

4. Settings Tab – To configure the settings parameters such as Navigational Panel, Nodes, Canvas, Number Formatting, Conditional Formatting and Color Theme.
   
5. General Tab – To configure the General settings such as License Registration, Export and Writeback functions.
   
In the next sections, you will be able to understand on how to design a value driver tree 
using these five different Tab categories in detail. 

As an initial step, follow the below steps to configure the design for
the value driver tree in Power BI.

1. Navigate to the “Visualizations Panel” and “Fields” Panel in Power BI
   (see Figure below).

    valQ Screen - Measures to be assigned

3. To create a value driver tree (valQ) in Power BI, it is mandatory to
   assign a Data Source to the value driver tree. For our example, a
   data source (sample data shown below) has been assigned to the value
   driver tree.

.. figure:: _static/11.2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Sample Data

4. Now at least one Measure Value has to be assigned to the property
   “Values” in Visualizations panel. In our example, we have assigned
   the Measure Value “∑ Forecast” to the property “Values” by clicking the
   check box option against the Measure Value “∑ Forecast” (see Figure
   below).

7. Secondary KPI



General
~~~~~~~

In General settings you will be able to configure the Node details such
as Unique ID, Title and the Title Prefix when outside the Tree with the
values as shown in the below Figure. The Title Prefix can be set at Node
Level and during simulation it is useful to identify at which node the
parameter value changes. The additional properties of the Node Tab has
been listed in Section 13.2.

.. figure:: _static/12.8.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Node – General Settings

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the valQ
screen as shown below.

.. figure:: _static/12.9.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ screen with General settings

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Unique ID for the Parent
Node is “TOP” and the Title of the Parent Node is “Net Profit”.

In our other example as shown below, we have configured the Title Prefix
for two different Nodes (see Figures below).

.. figure:: _static/12.10.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node with Prefix value as Spouse 1

.. figure:: _static/12.11.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node with Prefix value as Spouse 2

Based on the above set of configurations, you will be able to view the
valQ screens as shown below.

.. figure:: _static/12.12.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

.. figure:: _static/12.13.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ screen with Spouse 2 Prefix

From the above two Figures you can observe that the “Gross Salary” is
the common Title for two different Nodes. In order to differentiate
them, we have provided the value for “Title Prefix when outside the
Tree” as Spouse1 for one Node and Spouse 2 for the other Node. After
simulation, you can see which Node’s value has been changed.

Configuration 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Configuration Settings, you will be able to configure the Node
details such as Calculation Method, Time Aggregation, Desired Trend and
Value Range with the values as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/12.14.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Node – Configuration Settings

Based on the above Configuration settings, you will be able to view the
valQ screen as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/12.15.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ with Configuration settings

From the above Figure you can observe that in the Navigation Panel, the
value that is displayed in the Constraints section will lie in the range
from minimum 10 to maximum 100 for a specific month based on the
configuration done for the Value Range. In our example, the calculation
method is selected as 'Subtract Children (a-b-c)' meaning that from the first child
node the other child nodes will get subtracted and its result will be displayed in the Parent Node. The
Time Aggregation is set to Sum of Periods where we have considered 12
months as period. As the result of simulation, each Node will display
the values based on the Sum of Periods. Also the “Desired Trend” has
been set to the Increase option. When simulated, the desired Trend for
the Revenue will be increasing and the value for the Total Cost will be
decreasing.

For the Calculation Method being selected as 'Data Source', you can follow the steps as explained in the following link : https://valq.com/blogs/3-methods-of-mapping-valq-nodes-to-data/

For other options of calculation method, you can refer the link: https://valq.com/blogs/assigning-values-to-nodes-in-valq/

On selecting 'Formula' and clicking on the formula field, you will be able to see a dropdown of the formulas that are supported. For a list of formulas that are available in valQ, you can refer to the link :doc:`Functions`

**Template Nodes** 

Also you can create a Template Node for the already existing Node. It
is very specific that the Template Nodes should not map the Parent
Node. You need to select the particular Node and copy a Node under the
selected Node for creating the Template Node.

In the below Figure as an example, you can observe that a copy of
Revenue Node has been created by the right click copy and paste actions.
Now the copied Revenue Node version is labelled as “Revenue 2” in
General Property of the Edit Node Window (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/13.3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Node: Copy of Revenue Node labelled as Revenue 2

Now navigate to the Configuration property of the Edit Node Window. Set
the Calculation Method to the option Template based on the node. Also
set the Node to use as Template to the option 1:Revenue (see Figure
below).

.. figure:: _static/13.4.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Node: Calculation Method selected as Template based on other node and Revenue Node to be used as Template

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Templated
Node Revenue 2 having all its Nodes similar to the Revenue Node as per
our example.

    Edit Node – Display Settings

Based on the above Display settings, you will be able to view the valQ
screen as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/12.17.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ with Display settings

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Node Display is set to
“Show” option. The Scale has been set to the User Selected option and
now you can edit the Scaling options in the Value Display under Settings
Tab. When the Scale is set to other options you will not be able to edit
the Scaling options in the Value Display. You can also view the Nodes
with the values configured with Value Decimal Places as “0”, Value
Prefix as “$” and Value Suffix as “r”. 

Since the Details on Click option is enabled in the Display settings,
you can observe the Pop up screen being displayed after clicking the Node
“Net Profit” (see Figure below). If the Details on Click option is
disabled in the Display settings, then you will not be able to view the
Pop up screen.

**Composite Node Display**

A Node in a tree can now be added with a maximum of two composite nodes which can be taken from any nodes. 
For our example, the below Figure shows the Tree structure with several nodes.

.. figure:: _static/cnd1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Tree with several nodes 

For our example, two child nodes from the Node “Total Cost” needs to be included as composite nodes to the 
Node “Revenue”. For adding the composite nodes, go to the configuration settings window of the Node “Revenue” 
by clicking the Edit (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cnd2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Adding Composite Nodes 

In the Edit Node panel, go to the Display settings and add the Nodes “10:Production Cost” and 
“36: Realisation Cost” as Composite Nodes to the Node Revenue (see Figure above). Now the Tree 
structure will get configured based on the above settings (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cnd3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Tree with composite nodes

You can observe that the Nodes “10:Production Cost” and “36: Realisation Cost” have been added as the 
composite nodes to the node “Revenue”. Also when a simulation is done in the actual 
Nodes (10:Production Cost” and “36: Realisation Cost), the similar simulation will get reflected in the 
composite nodes and it is vice versa (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cnd4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Composite Node with simulated values

Conditional Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Conditional Formatting option, you will be able to apply the Alert Thresholds and Rules at the specific Node Level (see Figure below). For our example, the Node "Revenue"
has been selected.

.. figure:: _static/cfn1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Conditional Formatting Settings for Node

In the Conditional Formatting settings for the Node "Revenue", you have 3 different options as highlighted in the above Figure. 

When the option "Global or Inherited Rule" is selected, then the Conditional Formatting Rules configured as Global Level in the Settings Tab  
will be applied here.

Now set the option as "Custom Rule: Overwrites default or any inherited rules" as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/cfn2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Conditional Formatting Settings for Node - Custom Rule option with Percentage selection

The Custom Rule option can be configured based on variance percentage values and the values applied at period level (see Figure above). 

For our first example, set the option for the Custom Rule as "Percentage" and also enable the property "Apply to Descendants". Set the Threshold values as shown in the above Figure.
After simulation, you can find that the Variance percentage value for the Node "Revenue" falls in the Threshold range (4%)* which is between -10% to -1% and based on that condition, the status bar for the Node Revenue is yellow color (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cfn3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with Percentage value selection for the Node "Revenue"

Also you can observe that the Descendant Node "Copper Price" has been updated with the same Threshold settings based on our configuration. 
The Variance percentage value for the Descendant Node "Copper Price" falls in the Threshold range (8%)* which is Above 1% and based on that condition, the status bar for the Descendant Node "Copper Price" is green color (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cfn4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with Percentage value selection for the Descendant Node "Copper Price"

For our second example, set the option for the Custom Rule as "Value (applied at Period Level) - see Figure below.

.. figure:: _static/cfn5.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with value selection for the Node "Revenue"

Set the Threshold values as shown in the above Figure. After simulation, you can find that the 
Metric value for the Node "Revenue" falls in the Threshold range (522.3)* which is Above 1 
and based on that condition, the status bar for the Node Revenue is green color (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cfn6.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with Value selection for the Node "Revenue"

**Note:**
"*" denotes that the Metric values get calculated based on the Period Level. For example when it is a Year, it will take the value of 12 being multiplied with the range value that we provide.

Now set the option to "Hidden: No Rule will be applied to this Node". You can observe that no range values can be provided for the Conditional Formatting and since there will be no status color for that Node being simulated. 

Secondary KPIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Secondary KPIs helps user to aggregate and visualize additional or alternate KPI values in the node widget. 
Specifically, in a model with two data series, these are the set of secondary metrics captured under the primary value of the node

.. figure:: _static/SecKPI.1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

As a default, there are three secondary values displayed for a dual series data in the following order
i. Full Period Variance between baseline and comparison metric (in % and absolute values)
ii.	Baseline metric value for the first period in the series 
iii. Variance for the first period between baseline and comparison metric (in % and absolute values) 

.. figure:: _static/SecKPI.2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

Secondary KPI option lets users to customize these secondary values or metric according to their preference 

Users can achieve this using:
I.	Secondary KPI option based on Formulas
II.	Secondary KPI option based on Template

I.	Secondary KPI option based on Formulas

In the below model screenshot, the user can display the data value from Operating Profit %’ and ‘Operating Expense Ratio’ as Secondary KPI values to the TOP node ‘Operating profit’.

.. figure:: _static/SecKPIF.1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

Under the 'Operating Profit' node setting's 'Secondary KPI' ribbon, user needs to select the 'Formula' button and fill-in the label name and the custom formula for his additional Secondary KPIs

.. figure:: _static/SecKPIF.2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

.. figure:: _static/SecKPIF.3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

Upon completing, the user can see ‘Operating Profit %’ and ‘Ops Expense Ratio’ values displayed as Secondary KPI values to ‘Operating profit’

.. figure:: _static/SecKPIF.4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text


II.	Secondary KPI option based on Template

In the model, user can display ‘Contribution’ of each of the child nodes Water, Beverages, and Others to their parent node Gross Profit. 
User should define ‘Contribution’ as a Formula in one of the nodes and call them out for ‘Contribution’ calculation using the Template option at the other nodes.

.. figure:: _static/SecKPIT.1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

In this example, user can define the formula in 'Water' node under the node setting's Secondary KPI by selecting 'Formula' button and defining the 'Custom Formula'
Upon completion, 'Contribution %' is displayed as a Secondary value of the node widget.

.. figure:: _static/SecKPIT.2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

To borrow this formula on other nodes, user can fo into the Secondary KPI setting of the 'Beverages' node, select the 'Template' button, and choose to display the same formula as the 'Water' node.
User can instantly see the corresponding 'Contribution %' at the 'Beverage' node.

.. figure:: _static/SecKPIT.3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

Similarly, following the same steps for the 'Other' node helps the user to instantly visualize ‘Contribution %’ for the all the child nodes to Gross Profit

*Additional Properties of New Tab*

Node Tab
========

Each node represents a metric, and can contain the following:

-  Name of the value driver or KPI

-  A sparkline graph indicating the recent trend

-  The value of the metric in bold letters

.. figure:: _static/13.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node Details

In addition, each node also contains several performance metrics (see
Figure below). They are listed as follows:

-  The Fiscal Year variance of the metric vs. a benchmark (in this case,
   Sales Forecast vs. Sales Budget) – this is shown in both % and
   absolute terms

-  Absolute value of the metric for the current month (usually the first
   period in the series)

-  Variance of the metric vs. a benchmark for the current month – this
   is shown in both % and absolute terms.

A node may be decorated by a performance indicator color band on the
left – typically Green (for good), Amber (neither good nor bad) and Red
(Poor).

.. figure:: _static/13.2.png

    Data Series Tab – Data Series Manager

For our example, we have the data source having periods from Jan to Dec, Budget and Forecast values. The Budget values will be the Comparison values and the Forecast values will be the Baseline values.
Follow the below steps for configuring the values in the Data Series Manager.

1. Set the property Period(s) per data series to the value 5. 
2. Configure the Period Labels as Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May (see Figure above).
3. Enable the property Include comparison data series. You can view both the Baseline and Comparison values.
4. When the property Include comparison data series is disabled, then you will be able to view only the Baseline Series.
5. Since our data set has the Additional values Additional 1 and Additional 2, it will be displayed as Additional Series (see Figure above).
6. When you click the Baseline label, you will be able view the Baseline values as Forecast values as shown below.

Nodes
-----

This Node settings allows you to map the Nodes to queries in the ID, Text or ID + Text Formats. In the Node Mapping settings in valQ, the Data Mapping Format has 2 options as listed below:
listed below (see Figure below).

1. Map based on ID or Text - For example, you can use this option if the field value exactly matches your Node’s unique
   ID or Text (e.g., Text - ‘Canada’)

2. Map based on ID-Text Pair - For example, you can use this option if your field has a key-text format
   (e.g., ‘CA:Canada’), and your Node’s ID corresponds to a key (e.g.,‘CA’).
