Features of VBX Charts
**********************
The VBX charts offer several detailed features that are not available with the standard components in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer. In the following sections you can find detailed information about these features.

Title and Subtitle
------------------
The title is by default displayed at the top of the chart, and an optional subtitle can be shown beneath it. The title and subtitle can also be moved using the available settings in the Additional Properties in the categories Title and Subtitle.

Axes
----
The X-Axis and Y-Axis are shown by default in all VBX charts, except the Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Funnel / Pyramid Chart, and any of the progression components. The axis labels, tick marks, and gridlines are closely linked and change with every change to the scaling parameters. The following sections outline the details for the axes formatting options.

Axis Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~
The axis labels can be configured for the X-Axis as well as for the Y-Axis and are either indicating a dimension member or the value for the data series. You have the option to configure elements such as a Prefix or Suffix as well as the option to stagger the axis labels in order to improve the readability. 

Ticks
~~~~~
Ticks are the lines placed along an axis to show either the different values or to show the different dimension members. You can configure the details, such as the Tick Interval, Tick Placement, and Tick Position in the category for each of the axis in the Additional Properties. In addition you have the option to enable major and minor ticks for the chart.

Gridlines
~~~~~~~~~
In addition to the option to enable ticks for the axis, you can also enable gridlines for the X-Axis as well as the Y-Axis. You can configure elements, such as the gridline color, gridline style, and gridline width for each of the axis of the chart. Minor and major gridlines are available for the values axis, and major gridlines are available for the dimension axis.

Tooltip
-------
The tooltip appears when you will be hovering over a point in a data series. By default the tooltip shows the value of the point and the name of the data series. At design time, the dashboard developer also has an option to enable a crosshair option, which displays a line connecting the points with their corresponding axis.

Legend
------
The legend will display the data series of the chart and display the assigned color and symbol of the data series. You also have the option to hide / unhide a data series by clicking on the element in the legend itself.
 
Plot Bands and Plot Lines
-------------------------
The VBX charts provide the option to enable a plot line and plot band for both of the axis. A plot line or plot band provides you with the option to highlight a specific area or to add a line for a specified threshold value.
Plot lines and plot bands provide the option to define the color, label, and the plot value/range. The lines and bands will always be in a 90 degree angle to the axis it is defined for. When a plot band/line is used on the X- and Y-Axis at the same time, the plot band/line on the Y-Axis will be shown in front, as seen in the example below (see Figure below).

    Plot bands and Plot lines in VBX Charts

Panning and Zooming
-------------------

In the Panning and Zooming area of the Additional Properties you have
the option to activate the zooming option for the X-Axis or Y-Axis. You
can use the mouse pointer and drag out a rectangle in the chart itself,
and the selected area will be used for zooming. Unlike pinch zooming,
you can't pan the zoomed area, but has to zoom out on a new area. On
touch devices, you can zoom by pinching in the chart area. On these
devices, you may also move the zoomed area by panning with one finger
across the chart.

3D Charts
---------

All the pie chart variants included in the VBX charts support a 3D
option. For all these charts, the following options are available:

-  **Enabled**: This indicates whether the 3D option is enabled or not.
   The possible values are true or false

-  **Depth**: The total depth of the chart with a default value of 100.

-  **Alpha & Beta**: The angles to rotate the view of the chart along
   the X-axis and Y-axis respectively.

Export 
------

All of the charts in the VBX suite do allow you to export the chart, as
shown in the below Figure. The export feature supports the options to export
the chart as a PDF, PNG, JPEG, or SVG vector file, or to print the chart
directly. The dashboard designer has the option to enable or disable the
export and printing option as part of the Additional Properties of the
chart in the category Export.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Chart Style Details
-------------------
As part of the Additional Properties each of the charts is offering detailed formatting options for elements such as the chart background, borders, plot areas, margin, padding, and so on. These details can be found in each of the different categories of the Additional Properties as well as in the category Appearance.

Layout and Positioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VBX Chart elements such as axis labels, data labels, legends, titles, and the export button can be positioned horizontally and vertically - relative to the top left corner - using the properties "Align" and "Vertical Align". The "Align" option can have the values left, right, and center. The Vertical Align property can have the values top, bottom, and middle.

Plot Area, Margin, and Padding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The plot area of the chart is the area within the axis, where the data series are plotted. In Figure below, the plot area is shown as an orange box. The margin options (Left Margin, Top Margin, etc) define the margin between the chart plot area and the chart borders. The padding options (Left Padding, Top Padding, etc) define the padding between the outer area of the chart and all elements inside the chart area, such as data labels and a legend.

Borders
~~~~~~~
For chart elements, such as data labels, labels, and the legend it is possible to define border details as part of the Additional Properties. The properties Border Width and Border Color can be used to define the border details. In addition, the property Border Radius can be used to enable curved edges. 

Fonts
~~~~~
All layout elements of the chart that include text have a Style option that allows setting text related properties such as Font Color, Font Style, Font Size, and Font Family. In addition there is an option to define a global override option and to select a global font for all elements of the chart.

Animation
~~~~~~~~~
The property Animation provides you the option to activate the chart animation for situations where something has changed in the chart. A change in the chart could be the change of a dimension, a drill down, or a scripted change of other chart properties. The default duration of the animation is 500 ms.

Conditional Formatting for Charts
---------------------------------
The charts as part of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) allow you to define a set of conditional formatting rules, allowing you to highlight information displayed in the chart itself based on a variety of conditions. You can define rules based on a comparison with a single measure, with a measure calculation, or based on a target value definition.
The following charts support the Conditional Formatting capabilities: 

- Pie Chart
- Pie Drilldown Chart
- Donut Chart
- Semicircle Donut Chart
- Funnel / Pyramid Chart
- Line Chart
- Column / Bar Chart
- Column / Bar Drilldown Chart
- Combination Chart
- Stacked Column Bar Chart
- Waterfall Chart
- Scatter Plot Chart
- Bubble Chart
- Fixed Column Chart

In the following sections we will outline the options to setup Conditional Formatting for the charts and provides examples for all three options to setup rules for this functionality. 

Conditional Formatting based on a Single Measure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first option for the Conditional Formatting is the ability to define rules based on a Single Measure. For our example we will assume that we have a Data source which outlines measure Net Value along 12 months of a year and we will use a Column / Bar Chart for our example (see Figure below). In addition our data source also contains the measure Cost and Profit.

.. figure:: _static/columnbarchart.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Column / Bar Chart

You can follow the steps below to configure Conditional Formatting based on a Single Measure:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows the measure Revenue along 12 months of the dimension Calendar Month.
3.	Add a Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Column / Bar Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.

    Highlighted Measure                             Here you can select the measure from the chart where the rule will be applied upon.
    Comparison Measure                              Here you can select the measure which will be compared against the Comparison Value.
    Operator                                        Here you can choose the operator that is used to compare the Comparison Measure with the Comparison Value.
    Comparison Value Type                           Depending on the configured options, the property Comparison Value will allow to enter a static value, or setup a dynamic cell selection, or select a dynamic measure.
    Dynamic Selection Value                         In case you choose to setup a Dynamic Comparison Value, then you can choose between a Cell Selection and a Measure Selection.
                                                    A Cell Selection allows you to select a single cell.
                                                    A Measure Selection allows you to leverage a second measure as comparison and values will then be compared row by row.
    Color                                           Here you can define the color for the Rule.

Configuring Identical Scaling
-----------------------------
As part of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) for SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, you can now configure several charts with an identical scale. This option is not available for charts with more than one Y-Axis or for charts without an axis, like the Pie chart. For Example, if one chart displays sales values and a second chart displays Cost of Goods Sold, then by defining an identical Axis Group for the Y-Axis in the Additional Properties, the dashboard designer can configure both of the charts with a common scale (see Figure below). Following are the charts that support Identical Scaling:

- Column/Bar chart
- Combination chart
- Fixed Column chart
- Line chart
- Scatter Plot chart
- Stacked and Grouped Column chart
- Stacked Area chart
- Stacked Column/Bar chart
- Super Combination chart

Once, two or more charts are assigned to an identical scale, all the charts assigned to this group will have the Y-Axis configured with a common scale. If the first chart shows Sales values between $5 Million and $10 Million and the second chart shows Cost values between $1 Million and $6 Million, then both the charts will be normalized between $1 Million and $10 Million.

To configure two or more charts with an identical scale, you can follow the steps listed below:

1.	In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer navigate to the Additional Properties of the first chart.
2.	Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Y-Axis.
3.	Navigate to the area Identical Scaling.
4.	Enter a new name for the property Identical Scaling Group Name and click Add/Update.
5.	Now select the newly created group from the property Select Group dropdown list.
6.	Select the second chart in your project.
7.	Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Y-Axis for the second chart.
8.	Navigate to the area Identical Scaling.
9.	Select the previously created group from the property Select Group dropdown list  (see Figure below).

    :alt: alternate text

    Identical Scaling

By assigning the identical group to both charts, you assigned both charts to an identical scaling and each time a change in scaling – for example based on filter values – will automatically update both charts.

Displaying Totals/Sub-totals
----------------------------
Our charts also provide an option to display the Total and Sub-Total values as a separate column or bar. This option can be enabled as part of the Additional Properties by navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series (see Figure: :ref:`Display Totals/Sub-totals`). The sub-totals are calculated as a summation of all data series for a particular dimension member. The totals and subtotals will be shown as a separate category on the X-Axis or Y-Axis (as shown in Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/total1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Example for displaying Totals/Sub-totals

Figure above shows a Column Chart outlining the sales revenue for several products and by activating the option Show Totals the chart would also include the Total Result values shown on the far right hand side for each measure.

    Displaying Totals/Sub-totals

Displaying Key & Text for Dimension Member
------------------------------------------
All of the VBX charts are offering you the option to choose between the Key, Text, or Key and Text values of the dimension members for the display in the charts. The option to configure the display of the dimension member is possible by navigating to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart and to the area General Settings (see Figure below). By default the charts will leverage the settings from the Initial View of the assigned data source, but you have the option to overwrite the configuration on a per chart basis.

    Displaying Key and Text

High Chart Theming Support
--------------------------
In addition to the standard style properties you will also find the area Chart Theme by navigating to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart of the Additional Properties (see Figure below). The dashboard designer can create a custom theme for the chart and in that way quickly apply color settings and a defined look and feel to the complete chart. 
By clicking on the Custom Theme Editor, you will be guided to a separate website (see Figure::ref:`customeditor`) and can configure the different elements of the chart and then export the necessary theme code.

.. figure:: _static/highcharttheme.png

    Custom Theme Editor

After applying the Custom Theme Code and enabling the Custom Theme support for the chart, the configured color settings should now be applied to your chart.

Support for Trendlines
----------------------
Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, most of the charts also are now able to support Trendlines as part of the visualization. Currently the supported Trendline types are:  Linear, Exponential, and Loess. You can find the Trendline option as part of the Additional Properties for the chart by navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Trendline (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/trendline.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Trendline

As shown in Figure above, you can enable the support for the Trendlines and you can choose for each individual measure which type of Trendline you would like to add to the chart. In the example above we added linear Trendlines for the measure Profit and Costs. 

.. figure:: _static/trendline2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Column Chart with Trendlines

Figure above shows the resulting Column chart with both Trendlines added to the visualization. In case you would like to add Trendlines only to some of the measure but not to all measures, you can use the entry “None” from the dropdown box to not show a Trendline for some of the measures.

Trendlines are currently supported by the following chart types: Area chart, Bubble chart, Column / Bar chart, Line chart, Scatter Plot chart, Stacked Area chart, Stacked Column / Bar chart.

Customizing Line Style and Marker Style
---------------------------------------
Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, those charts that offer the display options of lines and markers – for example a Line chart – also provide the ability to customize those options. The options to customize the Line Style and Marker Style can be done by navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and to the area Marker in the Additional Properties of the chart (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/linemarker.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Line and Marker options

Figure above shows the options to customize the Line Style and Marker style for a measure and you can try having more than one measure. You have the option to set a Line Style and customize the Marker Symbol, Marker Size, and Marker Color.

Adding Error Bars
-----------------
Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions our charts also provide the option to add Error Bars to the display of the chart. Error Bars can be used to provide an additional visual representation of the variability of the data and are normally used on graphs to indicate the error range.

.. figure:: _static/errorbar.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Error Bar Option

Figure above shows the detailed options for the Error Bar area by navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Error Bar of the Additional Properties.

- Error Amount: The Error Amount can be set to Fixed Value, Percentage Value, Standard Deviation, or Custom. In case of the option Custom you will then have the option to first choose the Data Series and in addition you can then select measures from the data source for the upper and lower limits of the error bars.
- Error Amount Value: In case of the Fixed Value or the Percentage Value option, you can enter the corresponding value.
- Stem Style: You can leverage properties such as the Stem Width, Stem Color, and Stem Style to configure the look and feel of the Stem.
- Whisker Style: You can leverage properties such as the Whisker Color, Whisker Length, and Whisker Width to configure the look and feel of the Whisker.

In case you choose the Custom option for the Error Amount you will receive three additional configuration options:

- Select Measure: Here you can select a measure from the data source and the Error Bar will be enabled for the selected measure.
- Upper Limit: Here you can select a measure from the underlying data source as value for the upper limit of the Error Bar.
- Lower Limit: Here you can select a measure from the underlying data source as value for the lower limit of the Error Bar.

    Column Chart with Error Bars

Figure above shows a Column chart with a simple Error Bar display configuration. 

Editing Measure Labels
----------------------
Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions you can now change the labels for the measures being used as part of the chart. By default, charts will use the label for the measure based on the meta-data retrieved from the underlying source, but you can also customize the label as part of the Additional Properties (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/seriesname.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Series Name Change

Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and to the area Series Name Change. You can simply enter a new name for each of the available measures and the chart will then use the changed name as part of the visualization.

Configuring Drill Down for Charts
---------------------------------
As part of the VBX Charts you also receive a set of Drill Down charts, which are able to leverage multiple dimensions or a hierarchy from the assigned data source and provide your users with the ability to drill down from an overview to a more detailed chart. In the following sections we will outline the detailed options on how you can setup a Drill Down chart either based on multiple dimensions or based on a hierarchical data set. Drill Down charts either require multiple dimensions as part of the data source or a dimension with an activated hierarchy. In addition Drill Down Charts offer several advanced features, which can be configured as part of the Additional Properties. You will have the option to either perform an actual Drill Down, meaning you will navigate to a more detailed chart, or you can choose to expand the chart inplace. For our first example on how you can configure a Drill Down Chart we will assume that our data source consists of dimension Calendar Year and dimension Calendar Month as well as measures Revenue and Cost.

You can follow the steps below to setup your first Drill Down Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a Column / Bar Drilldown chart to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
3.	Add a data source to your project. For our example we assume the data source has dimension Calendar Year and Calendar Month, as well as measures Revenue and Cost.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down (see Figure below). 

.. figure:: _static/data2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Category Data 

8.	In the sub category Drill Down you have several options to configure the Drill Down behavior. You can find the details in Table below:

.. _dataseriesproperties:

============================================== ============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================ 
        Option                                                    Description
============================================== ============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================ 
    Show all Measures	                            You can use this property to enable / disable the showing of all measures in a Drilldown. In case this option is disabled, then the drill down will only show the measure that was clicked.
    Show Totals	                                    This property allows you to show / hide totals for the chart itself. The totals will only be shown on the first view of the charts, but will not be shown on the next drill down levels.
    Total Node Placement	                        This property allows you to decide if the Total node should be placed before or after the members of the drill down.
    Show Parent Nodes on Drilldown	                In case this property is activated, then the parent node will be included in the Drill Down chart in addition to the members from the next level.
    Parent Node Placement	                        This property allows you to decide if the parent node totals should be placed before or after the members of the drill down.
    Enable Scroll Bar	                            This option allows you to enable / disable the scroll bar.
    Scrollable Chart Width/Height	                Sets the Width/Height of the Chart greater than the Container Width/Height. 
    On Click	                                    Using the On Click property you can specify which functionality should be used when you click on an element of the data series in the chart. The available options are: Drilldown, Expand / Collapse, Select, None. 
    On Double Click	                                Using the On Double-Click property you can specify which functionality should be used when you double-click on an element of the data series in the chart. The available options are: Drilldown, Expand / Collapse, Select, None.
    On CTRL	                                        Using the On CTRL-Click property you can specify which functionality should be used when you press the CTRL Key and clicks on an element of the data series in the chart. The available options are: Drilldown, Expand / Collapse, Select, None.
    Enable Hierarchy Drilldown	                    This option allows you to enable / disable a Drill Down based on an active hierarchy in the data source.
    Include Root Level Nodes	                    Using this property you can include or exclude the root level nodes of an active hierarchy into the Drill Down chart. This option only impacts Drill Down charts using a hierarchy.
    Max. no. of Hierarchy Levels	                Using this option you can define a maximum for a Drilldown chart using hierarchies. By specifying the maximum number of hierarchy levels you can limit the data volume, which you will be able to retrieve using the drilldown chart.
    Activate Hierarchical Labeling	                Using this property you can activate a specific labeling which will visualize the hierarchical nature of the data and keep the labels on the X-Axis (for example with a column chart) grouped together based on the drill down.
============================================== ============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

*Data Series Properties*

9.	For our example we will activate the following options:

- Show Parent Nodes on Drilldown
- Show all Measures
- Activate Hierarchical Labeling

10.	For all other options we will use the default values, which means that you will be able to use a drill down with a double-click and the inplace Expand / Collapse option with a single-click.
11.	Now use the menu Application • Execute Locally to see the chart and use the Drilldown.
12.	Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure below. 

.. figure:: _static/drilldownchart.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Drilldown Chart

13.	Now use a double-click on any of the columns in the chart (see Figure below). 

.. figure:: _static/drilldownchart1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Drilldown Chart

14.	You can now see the next dimension based on the Drilldown and because we activated the option to see all measures, we can see measure Revenue and measure Cost. In addition we can see the parent node shown on the left hand side, in our example the node for the year 2014.
15.	Click on the Back button in the top right corner to go back to the initial view.
16.	Now use a single click on the measure for the year 2014 (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/drilldownchart2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Drilldown Chart

17.	In this example we expanded the data to the next level. In our example we expanded the year 2014 to show the 12 members of dimension Calendar Month. In addition we can now see the hierarchical labeling showing the year and month labels in separate rows and we can also notice that the entry for the year 2015 is still visible because we used the inplace expand instead of the drilldown.
18.	Close the browser and navigate back to SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

In the first example we used the Drill Down chart with a set of dimensions. In our next example we will use the Drill Down chart with a hierarchy from the assigned data source.

You can follow the steps below to setup your first Drill Down Chart with a hierarchy:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a Column / Bar Drilldown chart to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
3.	Add a data source to your project. For our example we assume the data source has dimension Product with an activated hierarchy, as well as measures Revenue and Cost along that hierarchy.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart. You will notice that the chart does not display the hierarchical information, because we first need to activate the hierarchical drill down.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down
8.	In the area Hierarchy Drilldown, activate the option Enable Hierarchy Drill Down.
9.	You will notice that the chart now shows the hierarchy from the underlying data source (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/hdrilldown.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Hierarchical Drill Down Chart

10.	You have the same options for the configuration (see Table: :ref:`Data Series Properties <dataseriesproperties>`) as well as navigation when you execute the application.
11.	For the configuration in regards to the Drill Down we will use the default values, which means that you will be able to use a drill down with a double-click and the inplace Expand / Collapse option with the single-click.
12.	Now use the menu Application • Execute Locally to see the chart and use the Drilldown.
13.	Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure above and you should be able to use a Drill Down as well as an inplace Expand / Collapse navigation.

In just a few steps we were able to use the Drill Down functionality of the chart and use a set of dimensions and a hierarchy to visualize our data.

Events
------
In addition to the Additional Properties, the charts are also offering the ability to add scripting code to specific events. The VBX charts support the following events:

- On Plot Background Click
- After Chart Load
- On Zoom
- On Select

In addition, those charts that do support plot bands - such as the Trend & Comparison charts - also support the following events in addition to the events listed above:

- On X-axis Plot Band Mouse Over
- On Y-axis Plot Band Mouse Over

Lasso and Reverse Lasso Selection
---------------------------------
The Lasso and Reverse Lasso selection allows you to either use a lasso selection and select those elements in the chart that are included in the selected area or to use a reverse lasso selection, which will select all elements of the chart that are outside of the selected area. In the following steps we will outline how you can leverage the Lasso and Reverse Lasso selection with the Visual BI Extension charts.

Lasso Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As part of the standard menu of the Visual BI Extension Charts you have the option to select the Lasso option (see Figure below). The Lasso option will select those elements in the chart that are inside the selected area. For our example, we will use a Column Chart with two measures – Forecast Amount and Sales Amount – and several dimension members.

    Gantt Chart using Logical OR operator

25.	Here you can observe that the Progress values for both the Rule 1 and Rule 2 will be displayed in the Gantt Chart (represented by red color) based on the conditions “greater than 50” and values “between 50 and 60”.
26.	Based on the above set of configurations, when logical operator AND is applied for the Rule 1 and Rule 2, then you can observe that the Progress values in the Gantt Chart (represented by red color in Figure below) will be visualized satisfying both Rules which denotes that it considers all the values above 50 (Rule1) and within the range from 50 to 60 (Rule 2).

Working with Data
*****************
In the following sections we will outline a set of steps in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer which will help you to get a better understanding on how the VBX charts are able to leverage the data as part of your next project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

Assigning a Data Source
-----------------------
Each of the VBX charts will require a connection to a data source as part of the SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. To add a data source to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project you can use a right click on the Data Source folder in the Outline of your project and select the menu Add Data Source (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/addds.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Adding a Data Source

In the pop up window as shown in Figure below you can first select a Connection and after doing so you can browse for a Data Source. After you selected the Data Source you can specify an Alias for the data source, which will be used as reference to the data source throughout your application. You can confirm the dialog using the OK button. 

.. figure:: _static/addds1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Specify Data Connection and Data Source

To edit the default view of the data source, right click on the newly added data source in the Outline of your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer application and select the meu option Edit Initial View… as shown in Figure below. 

.. figure:: _static/eiv.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Initial View

The Initial View Editor (see Figure below) allows to select rows, columns, and filters for the view of your data source as well as configuring properties such as a scaling factor for a measure. By default, all the dimensions and measures added to the Rows, Columns, and Background Filter will be used when the data source is being assigned to a component.

.. _Editiv:

    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Initial View

After the data source has been added to the SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project, it can be assigned to the charts from the VBX suite. You can assign the data source to a component using the property Data Source (see Figure below) or using a simple drag and drop navigation, dragging the data source from the Outline to the component in your project.

    Data Source Selection

Data Utility Feature in VBX Charts
----------------------------------
Each of the charts in the VBX suite also comes with the option to enable the Data Utility tool (see Figure below). The Data Utility functionality provides you with the ability to select a subset of dimensions and measures from the assigned data source for the chart. For example, your data source could contain the dimensions Product Category and Region, and the measures Sales Amount and Profit Amount, but your chart is supposed to only display the Sales Amount by Region. In this situation the Data Utility allows you to re-use this data source and select the dimensions and measure that should be used, instead of using the complete data set. As the Data Utility tool allows you to specify the dimensions and measures per chart, it helps you to reduce the overall number of data source and in that way helps you to improve the overall performance of your application.

    Data Tab – VBX Charts  

Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility in the Additional Properties of the VBX Charts (see Figure above). After you enabled the Data Utility tool by activating the option Enable Data Utility Tool, you can set the Data Source Definition type and select both the measures and dimensions (see Figure below). All Dimensions that are available in the Rows and Columns of the initial view are shown as part of the Rows, Columns, and Measures area of the Data Utility tool.

Data Source Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As part of the Data Utility tool, you have the option to configure the property “Data Source Definition” to be based on the Technical ID or to be based on the Index.

•	The option Technical ID allows you to specify the dimensions and measures based on their technical names. 
•	The option Index Based allows you to specify an index value (zero based index), and the index will specify the position of the dimension or measure in the assigned data source. For example a index of 2 for the measure will then use the third measure (0, 1, 2) of the assigned data source. By using the option Index based, you can keep the dimension and measure assignment dynamic, as the Data Utility will then always leverage the dimensions and measures based on the assigned index, even when there are changes in the underlying structure of the data source.

For our example we will select the option “Technical ID” as shown in Figure below. The dimension Region is selected, along with the measures Profit and Net Value.

    Data Utility

You also have the option to set the following properties for the Data Utility (see Figure above).

•	Include Result from Data Source: This property allows you to include Totals and Subtotals from the Initial View of the Data source.
•	Include Result: When this property is activated, you have the option to include totals / subtotals for the selected dimension / measures and choose the aggregation function in the next property.
•	Measure Aggregation: Using this property, you can configure the aggregation function for the totals / subtotals. The available options are: Min, Max, Average, Count, Distinct Count, Sum, Percentage Share, and Running Total.
•	Suppression Type – This property allows you to configure a Zero and Null suppression for the Rows and Columns. The Zero / Null Suppression will be performed on the configured element of the Data Utility Tool.

.. _CommonProperties:

Common Properties of VBX Charts
*******************************
The following sections outlines the common properties of the VBX Charts that are available in the Additional Properties. Properties that are specific to a particular chart component are discussed separately.

General
-------
The General category lists the component name and type which are not customizable. The property Visible controls the visibility of the component dynamically.  

Data Binding
------------
The dashboard designer can use the Data Source property in the Standard Properties of the chart to assign a data source to the chart. In addition you can leverage the previously mentioned Data Utility tool.

Display
-------
The CSS Class property in the Standard Properties allows you to specify the CSS class name that is added to the component at runtime. This class can be referenced using the custom CSS file from the application properties. 

Layout
------
Properties related to the component margins and size are available under the Layout category in the Standard Properties. For any component, a maximum of two properties between margins and size can be set to auto for the component to adjust the size and position dynamically.

Additional Properties Sheet – German Support
--------------------------------------------
As part of VBX Release 2.32, you have the option to view the Additional Properties Sheet in German Language. The user can switch to English as well as German Languages based on their choice (see Figure below).

Trend and Comparison Charts
***************************
The VBX Suite consists of a group of chart components that highlight trends over time or are used to compare elements among each other. 

Trend & Comparison Charts Overview
------------------------------------
As part of the list of charts in the VBX suite, you also receive a set of Trend and Comparison Charts. This group includes the following charts: Line Chart, Column / Bar Chart, Combination Chart, and Area Chart. In the following sections we will outline the details for each of these chart types.
 
Line Chart 
----------
The Line Chart is represented by a series of values connected with a straight line. Line Charts are most often used to visualize data that changes over time to indicate a potential trend. The Line Chart in the VBX suite also has an option to indicate the trend as a spline (smoothed line) instead of a standard straight line. A sample line chart is shown in Figure below.

    Line Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Line Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Line Chart are at least one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Line Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 

How to use the Line Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Line Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Line Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows the measures Revenue and Cost along 12 months of the dimension Calendar Month.
3.	Add a Line Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Line Chart.
5.	The Line Chart will plot the information from the assigned data source (see Figure below).

    Line Chart

Figure above shows the basic Line Chart for two measures. You can use now the Additional Properties to customize the layout and look and feel. 

Column / Bar Chart
------------------
The Column / Bar Chart component is similar to a Line Chart, except that the information is visualized either as columns or as bars. Figure below shows a sample column chart.

.. figure:: _static/cb1.png

    Column / Bar Chart

Option for Runtime Deviation Bar in Column Bar Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart in the category Appearance and the sub category Chart, you have the option to activate the property Enable Deviation Bar to display the Deviation Value between one Column Bar and the other Column Bar. The deviation will be represented through a thin line bar showing the positive deviation in green color and the negative deviation in red color.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the Deviation Bar in the Column Bar Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows the measure Order Quantity along the dimension Item Category. 
3.	Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects/SAP Lumira Designer.
4.	Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart. 
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart (see Figure below). 
8.	Activate the option Enable Deviation Bar (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cb2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Enable Deviation Bar

9.	Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to visualize the Column Bar Chart enabled with Deviation Bar (see Figure below). In our example, you can observe that a positive Deviation Order Quantity value of 93104 occurs for the dimension Movies in comparison with the dimension Books. The deviation will be calculated as Mouse Hover Column Bar Value Minus (-) Selected Column Bar Value. In our example, the Mouse Hover Column Bar takes the Dimension “Movies” and the Selected Column Bar takes the Dimension “Books”.

    Column Bar Chart with Runtime Deviation Bar

10.	Now navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart (see Figure below). 
11.	Activate the option Deviation as % (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cb4.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Enable Deviation as %

12.	Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to visualize the Column Bar Chart enabled with the option Deviation as % (see Figure below). In our example, you can observe that a positive Deviation Order Quantity value of 48.74% occurs for the dimension Movies in comparison with the dimension Books. The deviation will be calculated as Mouse Hover Column Bar Value Minus (-) Selected Column Bar Value Divide (/) by Selected Column Bar Value x 100. In our example, the Mouse Hover Column Bar takes the Dimension “Movies” and the Selected Column Bar takes the Dimension “Books”.

+=========================================================================================================================================================+
| The option Deviation as % will be only functional when the option Enable Deviation Bar is enabled in the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart. |                                                                       
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Option to enable Pareto Series in Column Bar Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart in the category Appearance and the sub category Chart, you have the option to activate the property Enable Pareto Series to display both Column bars and a Line where individual values are represented in descending order by column bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line. 
The Column Bar Chart with Pareto Series is useful for figuring out the most significant factors in your data and how they contribute to the entire set. Also, you can discover the areas for improvement from the Pareto Series. For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the Pareto Series in the Column Bar Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows the measure Number of Mobile Phone Returns along the dimension Return Reasons.
3.	Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart. 
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart (see Figure below). 
8.	Activate the option Enable Pareto Series (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cb6.png

    :alt: alternate text

    Enable Pareto Series

Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to visualize the Column Bar Chart enabled with Pareto Series (see Figure below). In our example, you can observe the following:

•	The Pareto line starts at the center of the Defect category and intersects the right vertical axis at 40 percent, meaning Defects account for 40 percent of all Mobile Phone returns. 
•	Moving along the Pareto line, the next stop is the center of Incorrect Pricing. The Pareto line at Incorrect Pricing intersects the contributing percentage axis at 70 percent, which means that the combination of Defects and Incorrect Pricing account for 70 percent of all Mobile Phone returns.  
•	One more category over, Wrong Product intersects the Pareto axis a little bit above 80 percent, which means 80 percent of all Mobile Phone returns are a result of Defects, Incorrect Pricing and Wrong Product.

    Column Bar Chart with Pareto Series

Now you can discover the areas for improvement where the Mobile Phone Store should allocate its efforts. Targeting improvements to Defects and Incorrect Pricing are more worthwhile than adjusting the prices (Expensive) or Quality of Mobile Phones (Poor Quality). 

Data Source Requirements for a Column / Bar Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Column / Bar Chart are at least one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Column / Bar Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 

How to use the Column / Bar Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Area Chart

Figure above shows a sample Area Chart with measure Sales along the 12 months of dimension Calendar Month.

Data Source Requirements for an Area Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for an Area Chart are at least one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain more information, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Area chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. In case the data source contains more than a single measure, the order of the measures in the initial view of the data source then decides the order of plotting the measure onto the chart.

How to use the Area Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Area Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Area Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows the measures Revenue and Cost along 12 months of dimension Calendar Month.
3.	Add an Area Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart.
5.	After the data source has been assigned, the chart plots the members of the dimension for the X-Axis and the measure values are plotted as area (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/a2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Sample Area Chart 

6.	The area between the axis and the line is filled with the selected color based on the configuration in the category Data for each of the Data Series.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in the Additional Properties of the chart.
8.	Using the property Select Chart Type you can choose between:

    •	Area: This is a classic vertical Area chart with the value axis (Y-Axis) being on the vertical axis.
    •	Area Horizontal: This is a horizontal Area chart with the value axis (X-Axis) being on the horizontal axis.
    •	Area Spline: The Area Spline chart uses a smoothed line (spline) with the values axis (Y-Axis) on the vertical axis.
    •	Area Spline Horizontal: The Area Spline Horizontal chart uses a smoothed line (spline) with the values axis (X-Axis) on the horizontal axis.

9.	You can enable Markers and customize the display of the Markers in the area Marker of the category Data. You can customize the Marker Symbol, Size, and Color.

Radar Chart
-----------
A Radar chart allows you visualize the values of one or more measures along several members of a dimension and instead of arranging those value as columns or bars, those values are arranged radially around a point. For example, Radar Charts can be effectively used in comparison between two or more products over a range of characteristics to determine its features.

Stacked Charts
**************
This section discusses the features and properties of stacked visualizations which can display more than one data series.

Stacked Charts Overview
-----------------------
Stacked charts are used for visualizations where the individual members are to be compared against each other along with the column / area as a whole (as shown in Figure below). The following stacked charts are included in the VBX suite:

- Stacked Area Chart
- Stacked Column Chart
- Stacked Bar Chart
- Stacked Percentage Column Chart
- Stacked Percentage Bar Chart 
- Stacked and Grouped Column Chart

.. figure:: _static/st1.png

    :alt: alternate text

    Stacked Charts

In the next sections we will provide details for a subset of all available stacked charts to outline the steps to use these chart types. We will outline the Stacked Column, Stacked Percentage Column, and the Stacked and Grouped Column Chart in more details. The Stacked Area and Stacked Bar charts are very similar to the Stacked Column chart type and you should be able to follow the steps even when using the Stacked Area or Stacked Bar chart type.

Stacked Column Chart
--------------------
The Stacked Column Chart provides you with the option to visualize a measure along two dimensions, with one dimension being displayed on the X-Axis and the other dimension being used to stack the values (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/st2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Stacked Column Chart

The above Figure shows a Stacked Column Chart displaying the measure value along a dimension for the Calendar Month as well as using dimension Region to stack the values for each column.

Data Source Requirements for a Stacked Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked Column Chart are at least one dimensions and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimensions or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the chart or use the complete data set as part of the visualization. A Stacked Column Chart can stack either the values by a dimension or stack measure values, which depends on the data source assigned to the chart.

    :alt: alternate text

    Stacked Chart

The above Figure shows another Stacked Column Chart, in this example we have one dimension Month in the Rows, one Dimension Product in the Columns, and a measure Costs in the Columns.
You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a Stacked Column Chart:

•	Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.
•	Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the Data source will be used for the stacking of the chart.

How to use the Stacked Column Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stacked Column Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with two dimensions – dimension Month and dimension Product – as well as one measures – Revenue. In the initial View of the data source we placed the dimension Month into the Rows, dimension Product is placed into the columns, and measure Revenue is placed into the Columns. 

You can follow the steps below to configure the Stacked Column Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows measures Revenue and along dimension Month and Product.
3.	Add a Stacked Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.
8.	In the area General Settings set the Select Chart Type to the value Stacked Column (see Figure below).

    Stacked Column Chart

The above Figure shows the result of our example with the values of dimension Month showing on the X-Axis and the members of dimension Product are used to stack up the values of the measure.

Stacked Percentage Column Chart
-------------------------------
The Stacked Percentage Column Chart is very similar to the previously outlined Stacked Column Chart, with the difference being that the values are shown on a percentage scale (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/st7.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Stacked Percentage Column Chart

The above Figure shows a Stacked Percentage Column Chart displaying the measure value along a dimension for the Calendar Month on the X-Axis and dimension Product as the dimension to stack the measure value.

Data Source Requirements for a Stacked Percentage Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked Percentage Column Chart are at least one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimensions or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the chart or use the complete data set as part of the visualization. A Stacked Percentage Column Chart can stack either the values by a dimension or stack measure values, which depends on the data source assigned to the chart.
You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a Stacked Percentage Column Chart:

•	Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.
•	Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the Data source will be used for the stacking of the chart.
 
How to use the Stacked Percentage Column Chart? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stacked Column Percentage Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with two dimensions – dimension Month and dimension Product – as well as one measure – Revenue. In the initial View of the data source we placed the dimension Month into the Rows, dimension Product is placed into the columns, and measure Revenue is placed into the Columns. 

You can follow the steps below to configure the Stacked Percentage Column Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows measures Revenue along dimension Month and Product.
3.	Add a Stacked Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.
8.	In the area General Settings set the Select Chart Type to the value Stacked Percentage Column and you will be able to visualize the Stacked Percentage Column Chart (see Figure above).
 
Stacked and Grouped Column Chart
--------------------------------
The Stacked and Grouped Column Chart allows you to not only stack values for a specific dimension but to also group values along a second dimension, so in total the chart allows you to visualize the information of three dimensions.

.. figure:: _static/st8.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Stacked and Grouped Column Chart

The above Figure shows a Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart visualizing dimension Region on the X-Axis and stacking up the values for the different products – Food, Home Appliances, and Electronics – for two groups.

Data Source Requirements for a Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart are at least one dimension in the Rows, one dimension in the Columns, and one measure in the initial view of the data source. In case the data source does contain additional dimensions or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the chart or use the complete data set as part of the visualization. 
You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a Stacked and Grouped Column Chart:

•	Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.
•	Each dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used to stack items inside each group. 
•	Measures will be used to group items together.
 
How to use the Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with dimension Month in the Rows, dimension Product Category in the Columns, and dimension Product Group as second dimension in the Columns as well as measure Net Value in the Columns.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project.
3.	Add a Stacked and Grouped Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.

    Stacked and Grouped Column Chart

The above Figure shows dimension Month along the X-Axis, dimensions Item Category and Item Sub category are being used to stack items inside each group and measure Order Cost is being used to group items together.

Stream Graph
------------
Stream Graph is a variation of a Stacked Area Chart, but instead of plotting values against a fixed, straight axis, a Stream Graph has values displaced around a varying central baseline. Stream Graph displays the changes in data over time of different categories with the help of flowing, organic shapes that somewhat resemble a river-like stream. 

.. figure:: _static/sg1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Sample Stream Graph

Data Source Requirements for a Stream Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Stream Graph is one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Stream Graph. 

How to use the Stream Graph?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stream Graph in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Stream Graph:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows four measures – Order Cost, Discount Amount, Order Quantity and Order Amount and two Dimensions – Item Category and Item Subcategory.          
3.	Add a Stream Graph from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Stream Graph.
5.	The Stream Graph will plot the information from the assigned data source (see Figure below).

    Stream Graph

The above Figure shows the basic Stream Graph for four measures and two dimensions. Here you can observe that the Measure Order Cost for the Dimension Item Subcategory Computers is 1,585,319 where the value is shown through the central baseline instead of plotting values against the axes. You can use now the Additional Properties to customize the layout and look and feel. 

Additional Properties of Stacked Charts
---------------------------------------
In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Properties outlined in :ref:`Section: Additional Properties Sheet <AdditionalProperties>`, the stacked charts also provide the Additional Properties for the X-Axis and Y-Axis outlined in :ref:`Section: Category General <AdditionalProperties1>`.

Scripting in Stacked Charts
---------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Stacked Charts are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.

    Advanced Gauge

In the last section, we have outlined on how you can setup a new Advanced Gauge as part of your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. In the next section, we will outline on how you can setup a new Linear Gauge as part of your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

Linear Gauge
------------
The Linear Gauge also allows you to visualize two measure values with a different look and feel when compared to Advanced Gauge. The Linear Gauge will be displayed in the form of a single gauge with two pointers based on the configuration of the additional properties for two measure values.

Data Source Requirements for a Linear Gauge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for an Linear Gauge is to define a Data Cell Selection, meaning to assign a single cell value to the Linear Gauge for each value you would like to display as part of the gauge.

How to use the Linear Gauge?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Linear Gauge as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. 
You can follow the steps below to configure the Linear Gauge:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows one measure - Sales Amount - and one dimension Product.
3.	Add a Linear Gauge from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Linear Gauge.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Linear Gauge. 
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and to the area Data Value in the Additional Properties of the Linear Gauge. For our example, set the property Number of Data Values to the option Double, so that we can assign two values to the gauge (see Figure below).
8.	Now for Data Value 1, enter the name for the property Data Series Name which would be displayed along with the selected data value in the form of a tool tip for the dial.     
9.	The property Data Value Type has two types Static and Dynamic. For our example, set the property Data Value type to the option Dynamic.
10.	When the property Data Value Type is selected as “dynamic”, you have the option to select a single cell for each data value from the overall data set. Click the button for the property Dynamic Data Value to select the value for Data Value 1.

Funnel Charts
*************
Funnel charts are used to visualize the progressive reduction of data as it passes from one phase to another, for example the data of a sales process with data starting with the sales leads on the top and going down to the qualified leads and finally to the closed deals.

Funnel Charts Overview
----------------------
As part of the VBX suite there are two different funnel charts available to you:

- Funnel / Pyramid Chart
- Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown Chart

While the Funnel / Pyramid chart is the basic chart to represent progressive stages of data, the Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown chart offers an extension of the basic functionality by adding the Drill Down functionality to the chart. Figure below shows a Funnel and Pyramid chart example.

    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Funnel / Pyramid Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Funnel / Pyramid Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Funnel / Pyramid Chart is a data source with a minimum of one dimension and one measure. In case of the Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown Chart the minimum requirements are to have at least two dimensions and one measure.

How to use the Funnel / Pyramid Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Funnel Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. 

You can follow the steps below to configure the Solid Gauge:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows a measure Revenue along dimension Sales Stage.
3.	Add a Funnel Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Funnel Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Funnel Chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.
8.	In the area General Settings ensure that the property Select Chart Type is set to the value Funnel.

9.	Your Funnel Chart should look similar to the above Figure.

Additional Properties of Funnel Components
------------------------------------------
The Additional Properties of the Funnel charts are shown as part of the common set of Additional Properties in :ref:`Section: Additional Properties Sheet <AdditionalProperties>`.

Scripting Functions for Funnel Charts
-------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Funnel Charts are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.

Progression Components
**********************
Part of the VBX Chart are also a set of components that can be used to show the progress of a single value against a given target values.

Progression Components Overview
-------------------------------
The following is a list of progression components that are included as part of the VBX suite (see Figure below):

- Progress bar
- Number counter
- Circular counter

 .. figure:: _static/pco1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Progression Components

Data Source Requirements for a Progress Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for any of the Progress Components is a data source with a minimum of one data cell. The progress components will visualize the value of a single cell and therefore you will have to configure a Data Selection in addition to assigning the data source to the component.

How to use the Progress Bar?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Progress Bar, which is one of the Progress Components.  The Number Counter and Circular Counter are working very similar and you should be able to follow the steps below with those components as well. 

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows measure Revenue along dimension Product.
3.	Add a Progress Bar from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Progress Bar.
5.	Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Progress Bar.
6.	In case the Standard Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Standard Properties to activate the display of the Standard Properties (see :ref:`Figure: Standard Properties <std>`).
7.	Select the property Data Selection.
8.	Use the button on the right hand side to open the Data Selection dialog.
9.	In the next dialog you have the option to select a single cell from the overall data set. 
10.	Select a single cell.
11.	Click OK to close the dialog.
12.	Your Progress Bar should look similar to Figure below.

Composition & Relationship Charts
*********************************
In this section of the VBX Charts we will take a closer look at charts that represent a composition of a measure or a relationship between several measures.
In this category we will discuss the following chart types:

•	Waterfall Chart
•	Heat Map
•	Scatter Plot Chart
•	Bubble Chart
•	Marimekko Chart

Waterfall chart
---------------
A Waterfall chart is used to visualize how an initial value is changing by showing the value increase and value decrease and the final balance (see Figure below). The VBX Waterfall chart has the ability to add an intermediate result, which can show the balance at a defined data point.

    Waterfall Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Waterfall Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Waterfall Chart are a data source with at least one dimension and one measure. The data source should indicate the positive and negative values. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Line Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 

 
How to use the Waterfall Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Waterfall Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension showing the value type and a measure with the actual value. 

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows a single measure along a dimension Value Type.
3.	Add a Waterfall Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Waterfall Chart.
5.	Your initial chart should look similar to Figure below.

    Waterfall Chart

6.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Waterfall Chart.
7.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
8.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series (see Figure below).

    Additional Properties

9.	In the area Chart Settings you can activate the option of an Intermediate Summary and you can choose after which value the Intermediate Summary will be placed using the property Place Intermediate Sum After.
10.	You also have the ability to enable a custom sort option and you can configure elements from the assigned data source as an Interim or Final Balance.
11.	For our example we place an Intermediate Summary after the value for the Service Revenue.
12.	Our Waterfall Chart looks now like shown in Figure below.

Sorting Options for Waterfall Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series, you can activate the properties Sort By and Enable Custom Sort to enable the sorting options for the Waterfall chart.

Sort By: Using this property in the area Chart Settings, you can sort the dimension members on the X-Axis based on a set of options. The options are Initial View, Dimension Text in Ascending order, Dimension Text in Descending order, Dimension Key in Ascending order, and Dimension Key in Descending order. For our example, we have selected the option Dimension Text in Descending order (see Figure below).

    Sort By option

Enable Custom Sort: Using this property in the area Chart Settings, you can sort the dimension members on the X-Axis by defining a custom sort order. For our example, we created a custom sort order by swapping the dimension member Audio Equipment in the place of Cameras (see Figure below).

Enable Interim / Final Balance from Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you wish to have an existing entry from the data source as an Intermediate Balance/Final Balance, then you can enable the property Enable Interim/Final Balance from the Data Source in the area Chart Settings. For our example, we have selected the existing entry as dimension member “Audio Equipment” and assigned the option as Intermediate Balance for that dimension member (see Figure below).

Hierarchy Drill Down options for Waterfall Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting with the release 2.0 of the Visual BI Extensions, you are provided with the following Hierarchy Drill Down options. You can configure the details by navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down (see Figure below). 

 .. figure:: _static/w10.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Hierarchy Drill Down
 
**Enable Hierarchy Drill Down**: Using this property, you can enable the Hierarchy Drill Down for the Waterfall chart based on the active Hierarchy based on the Initial View of the data source.

**Include Root Level Nodes**: Using this property you can include or exclude the Root Level Nodes of the active hierarchy.  
Max no. of Hierarchy Levels: Using this property, you can specify the maximum number of levels from the hierarchy, which will be available for the Drill Down navigation. By specifying the maximum number of hierarchy levels you can limit the data volume, which you will be able to retrieve using the drilldown option.

**Activate Hierarchical Labeling**: Using this property you can activate a specific labeling which will visualize the hierarchical nature of the data and keep the labels on the X-Axis grouped together based on the hierarchical structure. For our example the labels of the both Category and Sub category items appear on the X-Axis (see Figure below).

    Hierarchical Labeling

**Enable Drill Down**: Using the property Enable Drill Down, you will be able to enable the Drill Down option for the Waterfall Chart. For our example, we have assigned the data set having the dimensions Item Category and Item Subcategory and measure Order Cost. Based on this configuration you will be able to visualize the Waterfall Chart with dimension Item Category with its dimension members for the measure Order Cost (see :ref:`Figure: Waterfall Chart with Dimension Item Category <wc1>`). When you double click on any one of the dimension member of the dimension Item Category - for our example “Books” - it gets drilled down to the next level showing the Waterfall Chart with dimension members for the dimension Item Subcategory (see :ref:`Figure: Waterfall Chart – Drilled Down to Dimension Item Subcategory <wc2>`).

    Waterfall Chart – Drilled Down to Dimension Item Subcategory

**Enable Hierarchy Drill Down**: When the property Hierarchical Drill Down is enabled, then you need to assign a data source having Hierarchy data set and visualize the Waterfall Chart based on the Hierarchy Drill Down configuration. In this scenario you will be able to visualize the Waterfall Chart representing the parent nodes and when you double click on any one element of the parent node, it gets drilled down to the next level showing the Waterfall Chart with the elements of the child node.

+========================================================================================================================================+
| The Hierarchy Drill Down option will only function when the Drill Down option for the Waterfall Chart is enabled.                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Stacked Waterfall Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As part of VBX Release 2.32, you have the option to set the property Select Chart Type as Stack Waterfall by navigating to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in the Additional Properties of the Waterfall Chart (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/swc1.png

    :alt: alternate text

    Select Chart Type

For our example, we have one dimension-Item Category with four Dimension members as Books, Electronics, Movies and Music and four Measures – Order Cost, Order Quantity, Order Amount and Discount Amount being assigned to the Waterfall Chart. Now by selecting the Chart Type as “Stack Waterfall”, you will be able to view the Waterfall Chart with each Measure being visually represented as a Stack for the respective Dimension member (see Figure below).

Scripting Functions for the Waterfall Chart
-------------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Waterfall Chart are listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`. 

Heat Map Chart
--------------
The Heat Map Chart gives you the option to visualize the information based on two dimensions and one measure (see Figure below). The two dimensions are being used to set the X-Axis as well as the Y-Axis, and the measure is being used to indicate – in form of a colored matrix – the value for the combination of these two dimensions.

    Heat Map Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Heat Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Heat Map Chart are a data source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one dimension in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source. In addition the data source should contain at least one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Heat Map Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 
You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a Heat Map Chart:

•	Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.
•	Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the Data source will be used for the Y-Axis of the chart.
 
How to use the Heat Map Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Heat Map Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Month in the Rows, a dimension Product in the Columns, and a measure Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Heat Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Heat Map Chart (see Figure below).

Scatter Chart
-------------
Scatter Charts are used to visualize the correlation of two measures for a given set of dimension members. A Scatter Chart is visualizing the two measures on the X-Axis and Y-Axis and the dimension members are just as a plotted point against those two measures. Scatter charts have the ability to show trends, clusters, or pattern in a large set of data.

•	Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the plotted points of the chart.
•	The first measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the X-Axis.
•	The second measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the Y-Axis.

How to use the Scatter Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Scatter Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Product in the Rows and measure Profit and measure Revenue in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Scatter Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Scatter Chart (see Figure above).
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Scatter Chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series (see Figure below).

Scripting Functions for the Scatter Chart
-----------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Scatter Chart are listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.

Bubble Chart
------------
Bubble Charts – very similar to a Scatter Chart – allow you to visualize several dimensions in a single chart. A Bubble Chart uses two measures – one on the X-Axis and one on the Y-Axis as well as a third measure, which is visualized in form of the bubble size.

 .. figure:: _static/bub1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Bubble Chart

The above Figure shows a Bubble Chart using measure Revenue on the X-Axis, measure Product Cost on the Y-Axis, and measure Margin is being used to define the Bubble size.

Data Source Requirements for a Bubble Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimum data source requirement for a Bubble Chart are a data source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and three measures in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Bubble Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 
You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a Bubble Chart:

•	Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used as a Data Series element and you can assign the different colors in the Additional Properties.
•	The first measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the X-Axis.
•	The second measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the Y-Axis.
•	The third measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used for the Bubble size.

 
How to use the Bubble Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Bubble Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Product in the Rows and measures Revenue, Cost, and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Bubble Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Bubble Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Bubble Chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series (see Figure below).

Scripting Functions for the Bubble Chart
----------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Bubble Chart are listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.

Marimekko Chart
---------------
A Marimekko chart is essentially a stacked column chart with a variable column width. In addition to the varying segment heights of a regular stacked column chart, a Marimekko chart is indicating an additional dimension using varying column widths. The variable column width on the X-Axis is based on the share of each member in relation to the total.

    Marimekko Chart

The above Figure shows a Marimekko Chart with the Product Group on the X-Axis showing the percentage values in relation to the total value and the individual Product is plotted in form of a stacked column chart for each individual Product Group.

Data Source Requirements for a Marimekko Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Marimekko Chart are a data source with at least two dimensions in the Rows, and one measure in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Marimekko Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 
You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a Marimekko Chart:

•	The first Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used as Dimension for the X-Axis.
•	The second Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data Source will be used as Dimension for the stacking of the values.
 
How to use the Marimekko Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Marimekko Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Month and a dimension Product in the Rows and measures Revenue in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.

Data Source Requirements for a Tree Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Tree Map Chart is a data source with single dimension in the Rows, and two measures in the Columns. 

How to use the Tree Map Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Tree Map Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. You can follow the steps below to configure the Tree Map Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows two measures - Sales Amount and Forecast Amount - and one dimension Product. 
3.	Add a Tree Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Tree Map Chart. 
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Chart. 
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Chart. In the area General Settings you can configure the type of Tree Map Chart using the property Select Chart Type. There are five different types and each type represents a different option to position and size the data:

    •	Slice and Dice
    •	Stripes
    •	Squarified
    •	Strip
    •	Horizontal stripes

8.	For our example, you can set the property Select Chart Type to the option Slice and Dice (see Figure below)

9.	Ensure that the property Enable Redraw is activated, so that the chart will be redrawn when the browser window is being resized at run time.  
10.	Set the property Dimension Value Display to the option Text Only.   This property allows you to choose if the dimension should be displayed with the Key, Text, or both values.
11.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of the Additional Properties for the Tree Map Chart. In the area Chart Settings you can assign the measures from your data source to the Size and Color options for the chart. (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/tm3.png

    :alt: alternate text

    Tree Map Chart – Category Data 

12.	Set the property Select Measure for Size to the measure Forecast Amount.
13.	Set the property Minimum Value Color to light blue. 
14.	Set the property Select Measure for Color to the measure Sales Amount.
15.	Set the property Minimum Value Color to dark blue.
16.	Set the property Select Type of Color Scheme to the option Min-Max Color which configures the type of color scheme that will be used. The options for the color schemes are listed below

    •	Min-Max Color
    •	Series Color
    •	Custom Color Pallet

17.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data Label in the Additional Properties. The Tree Map Chart can use 2 dimensions for which the data labels inside the containers will be shown. As shown in Figure below, you can configure the appearance of the data label for each level individually.

Scripting Functions for the Tree Map Chart
------------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Tree Map Chart are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.  

In the last section, we have outlined on how you can setup a new Tree Map Chart as part of your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. In the next section, we will outline on how you can setup a new Tree Map Drill Down Chart as part of your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

Tree Map Drill Down Chart
-------------------------
Tree Map Drill Down Chart is a version of the Tree Map Chart that is able to provide the Drill Down functionality for the Tree Map Chart. The Tree Map Drill Down Chart provides your users the option to Drill Down from a member in a higher level dimension or a higher level of a hierarchy to more detailed information. 

Data Source Requirements for a Tree Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Tree Map Chart is a data source with two dimensions in the Rows, and two measures in the Columns. 

How to use the Tree Map Drill Down Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have two different scenarios for the Tree Map Drill Down Chart and they are outlined in the sections below.

**Scenario 1:**
In Scenario 1, we will outline how you can setup a new Tree Map Drill Down Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. 

You can follow the steps below to configure the Tree Map Drill Down Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows two measures - Sales Amount and Forecast Amount - and two dimensions Product Category and Product. 
3.	Add a Tree Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Tree Map Drill Down Chart. 
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Drill Down Chart. 
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Drill Down Chart. In the area General Settings you can configure the type of Tree Map Chart using the property Select Chart Type. There are five different types and each type represents a different option to position and size the data:

    •	Slice and Dice
    •	Stripes
    •	Squarified
    •	Strip
    •	Horizontal stripes

For our example, you can set the property Select Chart Type to the option Slice and Dice (see Figure below)

Scripting Functions for the Tree Map Drill Down Chart
-----------------------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Tree Map Drill Down Chart are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`. 

Special Charts
**************
In this category we will take a look at charts that do not fit into any of the other categories. In this section we will discuss the following chart types:

•	Dual Axis Chart
•	Multiple Axis Chart
•	Super Combination Chart
•	Sparkline Charts
•	Sparkline Table Chart
•	Tag Cloud Chart
•	Waffle Chart
•	Risk Matrix Chart
•	Calendar Heat Map Chart
•	Sunburst Chart

Dual Axis Chart
---------------
The Dual Axis Chart provides an additional Y-Axis and allows you to plot multiple sets of data as part of a single chart. For Example, when measures like Actual Sales, Budgeted Sales, and Profit in % need to be plotted on a chart, Actual Sales and Budgeted Sales can be plotted on the primary axes and the Profit values shown as a percentage can be plotted on the secondary axes.

    Dual Axis Chart

The above Figure shows the Actuals in form of a Column and the Budget in form of a Line chart, both combined in a Dual Axis Chart.

Order of Displaying Different Chart Types
-----------------------------------------
In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Data and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the “Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing the Series Order of the measure items, the order of display for the charts and the order of legend for the measure items will be changed based on the changed Series Order.  

For our example, in the additional properties of the Dual Axis Chart the default Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure below. 

 .. figure:: _static/da2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Default Series Order

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize the Dual Axis Chart being displayed with the default order of legend items and the default order of display of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount and Order Amount (see Figure below). 

 .. figure:: _static/da3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Default Series Order
 
For our example, in the additional properties of the Dual Axis Chart change the Series Order for the measure items Discount Amount and Order Amount so that the order of legend items and the order of display of the charts for those measure items will be changed (see Figure below). 

 .. figure:: _static/da4.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Changed Series Order

Based on the above configuration, the Dual Axis Chart will be displayed with the changed order of legend items and the changed order of display of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount and Order Amount (see Figure below).

    Changed Series Order

Option to have one Stacked Chart per Available Axis
---------------------------------------------------
In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Data and the sub category Data Series, the Stacked Chart types which are assigned to the measure items can be now mapped to more than one Y-Axis.

For our example in the area Series Type, the measure Order Cost is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Quantity is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type and measure Order Amount is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/da6.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Series Type

In the area Series Y-Axis, the measure Order Cost is assigned to the Y Axis 2, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 1, measure Order Quantity is assigned to the Y Axis 2 and measure Order Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 1 (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/da7.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Series Order and Series Y-Axis

Based on the above configured settings on Series Type and Series Y-Axis, you can visualize the Dual Axis Chart (see Figure below). You can observe that the measures Discount Amount and Order Amount takes the plot values of Y-Axis 1 and the measures Order Cost and Order Quantity takes the plot values of Y-Axis 2.

    Series Y-Axis

Adding Trendlines 
-----------------
In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Data and the sub category Trendline, you have the ability to add the trendlines to the Dual Axis Chart similar to other Charts.

For our example, activate the option Enable Trendline and assign the Trend Type as “Linear” and the desired Color for the Measure items Order Amount and Order Cost (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/da9.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Enable Trendline

Based on the above configuration, you can visualize the Dual Axis Chart with the Trendlines assigned to the Measure items Order Amount and Order Cost (see Figure below).

Data Source Requirements for a Dual Axis Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Dual Axis Chart is a data source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or more measures in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Dual Axis Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 

How to use the Dual Axis Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Dual Axis Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Product in the Rows and measures Revenue, Cost, and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Dual Axis Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Dual Axis Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series (see Figure below).

    :alt: alternate text

    Category Data 

8.	In the area Series Type you can configure the type of visualization for each of the Data Series in your chart. The available options are: (see Figure above)

    •	Column
    •	Column Stacked
    •	Column Stacked Percent
    •	Line
    •	Spline
    •	Area
    •	Area Stacked
    •	Area Stacked Percent
    •	Area Spline
    •	Area Spline Stacked
    •	Area Spline Stacked Percent

9.	In our example we are setting the following Series Type: 

    •	Measure Profit: Column Stacked Percent
    •	Measure Costs: Column Stacked Percent
    •	Measure Net Value: Column

10.	In the Series Y-Axis area of the Additional Properties you can decide which measure is being plotted onto which axis in the chart (see Figure above).

Multiple Axis Chart 
-------------------
The Multiple Axis Chart provides the option to setup a chart with as many axis as you have measures in the assigned data source, meaning you could create a chart with an axis for each measure. 

 .. figure:: _static/ma1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Multiple Axis Chart

The above Figure shows the Actuals in form of a Column, the Pre Budget and Post Budget measure in form of a Line chart and each measure has been plotted against their own axis.

Order of Displaying Different Chart Types
-----------------------------------------
In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the category Data and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the “Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing the Series Order of the measure items, the order of display for the charts and the order of legend for the measure items will be changed based on the changed Series Order.  

For our example, in the additional properties of the Multiple Axis Chart the default Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure below.  

 .. figure:: _static/ma2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Default Series Order

Based on the above configuration, the Multiple Axis Chart will be displayed with the default order of the legend items and the default order of display of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/ma3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Default Series Order

For our example, in the additional properties of the Multiple Axis Chart change the Series Order for the measure items Discount Amount and Order Amount so that the order of legend items and the order of display of the charts for those measure items will be changed (see Figure below).  

 .. figure:: _static/ma4.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Changed Series Order

Based on the above configuration, the Multiple Axis Chart will be displayed with the changed order of legend items and the order of display of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount and Order Amount will be changed (see Figure below).

    Changed Series Order

Option to have one Stacked Chart Type per Available Axis
--------------------------------------------------------
In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the category Data and the sub category Data Series, Stacked Chart types which are assigned to the measure items can be now mapped to more than one Y-Axis. 

For our example in the area Series Type, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Amount is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Cost is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type and measure Order Quantity is assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/ma6.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Series Type

In the area Series Y-Axis, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 4, measure Order Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 2, measure Order Cost is assigned to the Y Axis 3 and measure Order Quantity is assigned to the Y Axis 1 (see Figure below). 

 .. figure:: _static/ma7.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Series Y-Axis
 
Based on the above configured settings on Series Type and Series Y-Axis, you can visualize the Multiple Axis Chart (see Figure below). You can observe that the measure Discount Amount takes the plot values of Y-Axis 4, the measure Order Amount takes the plot values of Y-Axis 2, the measure Order Cost takes the plot values of Y-Axis 3 and the measure Order Quantity takes the plot values of Y-Axis 1.

    Series Y-Axis

Adding Trendlines 
-----------------
In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the category Data and the sub category Trendline, you have the ability to add the trendlines to the Multiple Axis Chart similar to other Charts.

For our example, activate the option Enable Trendline and assign the Trend Type as “Linear” and the desired Color for the Measure items Order Amount, Order Cost and Order Quantity (see Figure below). 

 .. figure:: _static/ma9.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Enable Trendline

Based on the above configuration, you can visualize the Multiple Axis Chart with the Trendlines assigned to the Measure Items Order Amount, Order Cost and Order Quantity (see Figure below).

Data Source Requirements for a Multiple Axis Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Multiple Axis Chart is a data source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or more measures in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Multiple Axis Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 

How to use the Multiple Axis Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Multiple Axis Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Calendar Month in the Rows and measures Revenue, Cost, and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Multiple Axis Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Multiple Axis Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series (see Figure below). 

 .. figure:: _static/ma11.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Category Data 

8.	In the area Series Type you can configure the type of visualization for each of the Data Series in your chart. The available options are: 

    •	Column
    •	Column Stacked
    •	Column Stacked Percent
    •	Line
    •	Spline
    •	Area
    •	Area Stacked
    •	Area Stacked Percent
    •	Area Spline
    •	Area Spline Stacked
    •	Area Spline Stacked Percent

9.	In our example we are setting the following Series Type: 

    •	Measure Profit: Line
    •	Measure Costs: Column
    •	Measure Net Value: Column

10.	In the Series Y-Axis area of the Additional Properties you can decide which measure is being plotted onto which axis in the chart (see Figure below). For our example we will plot each measure on its own Axis (see Figure below).

Scripting Functions for the Super Combination Chart
---------------------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Super Combination Chart are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`. 

Sparkline Charts
----------------
The Sparkline charts (see Figure below) are a condensed form of a line chart (or bar chart, or area chart), where the focus is on the variation of the overall trend. The chart plot area has no axes, data labels, legends or title/sub-title.

    Sparkline Chart

The Sparkline Chart component supports the following chart types:

•	Area Chart
•	Line Chart
•	Column Chart
•	Bar Chart 
•	Win Loss Chart
•	Bullet Chart

Data Source Requirements for Sparkline Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sparkline charts do allow you to leverage dimensions and measures as part of the rows and columns in the underlying data source but it is important to understand how sparkline charts will use the dimensions and measures in the rows and in the columns.
Dimensions that are being placed into the Rows area of the initial view of your data source will also be used as part of the rows of your sparkline chart.  In a situation where multiple dimensions are being stacked in the Rows area, then those dimensions will be shown in the rows of the sparkline chart and you will see a chart for each element of the rows.
For dimensions or measures placed into the columns, the logic is slightly different. The first element – also being referred to as the outer element – being placed into the columns will be used to split the columns of the sparkline charts and the next element will be plotted in the chart itself.

 
To illustrate the logic, let us take a look at a quick example. For our example we assume that we have a data set containing dimension Country and dimension Region in the rows and measure Revenue in the column.

    Sparkline Chart-Scenario 1

The above Figure shows how such a data set could be used to visualize the single measure for those two dimensions in form of a sparkline bar chart. Expanding on the previous example, we will now add dimension Calendar Month to the columns, so that we have measure Revenue first and dimensions Calendar Month as the inner dimension in the columns.

    Sparkline Chart-Scenario 2 

The above Figure shows how a Sparkline chart would show the Revenue broken down by Calendar Month for the two dimensions in the rows.
 
How to use the Sparkline Charts?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new set of Sparkline Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Product in the Rows, dimension Calendar Month in the Columns, and measures Revenue and Cost in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source. In the Columns we have the Measures as outer dimension and dimension Calendar Month as inner dimension.

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Sparkline Chart component from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Sparkline Chart component.
5.	Based on the data source structure, your Sparkline Chart component should look similar to Figure below.

Scripting Functions for the Sparkline Chart Component
-----------------------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Sparkline Chart are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.

Sparkline Table Chart
---------------------
The Sparkline Table enables you to build a Table whose columns can be dimension members, measure values, or embedded Sparkline charts. All parts of the Table like Header, Data cells, etc can be customized by a wide range of properties.

    Sparkline Table Chart

The above Figure shows an example of a Sparkline Table Chart combining information in form of simple measure columns – such as the column Income – as well as charts inside the Table, such as the Income per Quarter.

Data Source Requirements for the Sparkline Table Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum requirements for the data source for a Sparkline Table Chart is a data source with at least one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Sparkline Table Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart. 

How to use the Sparkline Table Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Sparkline Table Chart. The Sparkline Table Chart allows you to add columns based on Dimensions, columns based on Measures, and you can add columns which will display Sparkline Charts. In the next set of steps we will show the detailed steps for each of those options. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with the following elements:

•	Dimension Product Group in the Rows
•	Dimension Product in the Rows
•	Dimension Calendar Month in the Columns
•	Measure Revenue in the Columns
•	Measure Profit in the Columns
•	Measure Cost in the Columns

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Sparkline Table Chart component from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Sparkline Table Chart component.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Sparkline Table Chart Component.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Table Definition (see Figure below).

    Dimension Column

2.	You can now enter a Column Header, define the Column Width, and select which Dimension you would like to add as column to the Sparkline Table.
3.	For our example we are using the following values:

    •	Column Header:		Product Group
    •	Column Width:		25%
    •	Select Dimension:		Product Group
    •	Dimension Display:		Text

4.	After entering those details click Save to add the new column to the Table (see Figure below).

Show Scaling Factor	                                This property allows you to enable / disable the display of the assigned Scaling Factor. In case the measure has an assigned Scaling Factor already based on the data source, then the value from the data source will be used. In case a Scaling Factor is being configured in the Additional Properties, then the Scaling Factor of the Additional Properties will be shown.
Scaling Factor	                                    Here you can configure a Scaling Factor for the measure column. A Scaling Factor defined here in the Additional Properties will overwrite a scaling factor defined in the data source.
Show Scaling Unit	                                This property allows you to enable / disable the display of the assigned Scaling Unit.
Show Unit / Currency	                            This property allows you to enable / disable the display of the assigned Unit / Currency value. In case the measure has an assigned Unit / Currency already based on the data source, then the value from the data source will be used.
Scaling Unit	                                    Here you can define a Scaling Unit.
Prefix	                                            Here you can configure a Prefix value for the Measure.
Suffix	                                            Here you can configure a Suffix value for the Measure.

*Scripting Functions*

Tag Cloud Chart
---------------
A Tag Cloud Chart is a visual representation of text data. Tags in the chart are usually single words and the importance of each tag is represented by the size and color.

    :alt: alternate text

    Tag Cloud Chart

The above Figure shows a sample Tag Cloud Chart for a list of products and two measures assigned to the size of the text and the color of the text.

Data Source Requirements for a Tag Cloud Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum requirements for the data source for a Tag Cloud Chart is a data source with at least one dimension and two measures. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Tag Cloud Chart.
You can follow these rules in regards to the data structure for a Tag Cloud Chart:

•	The first dimension in the Rows will be used for the Text value.
•	The first measure in the Columns will be used for the Font Size.
•	The second measure in the Columns will be used for the Font Color.

How to use the Tag Cloud Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Tag Cloud Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with the following elements:

•	Dimension Product in the Rows
•	Measure Net Value in the Columns
•	Measure Profit in the Columns
•	Measure Cost in the Columns

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Tag Cloud Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Tag Cloud Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Tag Cloud Chart Component.
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart (see Figure below).

    Category Appearance

8.	In the area General Settings you can configure the following properties:

    •	Dimension Value Display: Here you can choose between the Key, Text, Key and Text, or Text and Key  as display option for the dimension members.
    •	Tag Cloud Shape: Here you can choose between an Elliptic or a Rectangular layout of the Tag Cloud Chart.
    •	Minimum Color: Here you can select the color for the Minimum value
    •	Maximum Color: Here you can select the color for the Maximum value.

9.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility (see Figure below).

 .. figure:: _static/tg3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Category Data 

10.	In the Category Data you can configure the following properties:

    •	Enable Data Utility Tool: In case you would like to specify other Dimensions or Measures for the chart, you can enable the Data Utility and then specify the elements for the chart.
    •	Select Dimension: Here you can select the dimension that will be used for the text value of the chart.
    •	Measure for Font Size: Here you can specify the Measure that will be used for the Font Size.
    •	Measure for Font Color: Here you can specify the Measure that will be used for the Font Color. 
    •	Select Aggregate Function: Here you can set the Aggregate Function for the measure values.

11.	For our example we will use the following settings:

    •	Enable Data Utility Tool:	Activated
    •	Select Dimension:		Product 
    •	Measure for Font Size:	Profit
    •	Measure for Font Color:	Costs 
    •	Select Aggregate Function:	Sum

12.	Your Tag Cloud Chart should now look similar to Figure below:

Waffle Chart
------------
The Waffle Chart will be displayed in the form of boxes in a 10 x 10 Matrix where the measure value will be represented in form of a static number or percentage value. A Waffle chart is often used to visualize the percentage share or achievement of a specific target value.

Data Source Requirements for a Waffle Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum data source requirement for a Waffle Chart is a data source at least two cell values, so that one cell selection would represent the value and the second value would represent the maximum value. In addition, the Waffle Chart can also leverage dimensions in the rows for the Dimension Stacking feature. 

How to use a Waffle Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Waffle Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Waffle Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows two measure - Sales Amount and Forecast Amount- and one dimension Product. 
3.	Add a Waffle Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Waffle Chart. 
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Waffle Chart (see Figure below). 
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in the Additional Properties of the Waffle Chart (see Figure below). In the area General Settings you can configure the type of Waffle Data using the property Select Chart Type. You have the option to choose between Percentage or Number. Percentage will represent the values as actual percentages, even when the assigned values are of numeric nature. Number will represent the assigned values as numeric values.

For our example, you can set the property Select Chart Type to the option Percentage (see Figure below).

8.	Set the property Value Color to Orange for those boxes representing the value.
9.	Ensure that the property Display Empty Boxes is enabled, so that the empty boxes will be displayed
10.	Set the property Empty Area Color to Grey for those boxes representing the empty values.  
11.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of the Additional Properties for the Waffle Chart (see Figure 4.302). In the area Calculation you can configure the Waffle Chart using Static Data, Dynamic Data and the option to setup a Calculation for two measures. For our example, we will proceed with the option to setup a calculation using two different dynamic data values. 
12.	Ensure that the property Enable Calculation is activated (see Figure below).

22.	You can also configure the Waffle Chart with a feature called Dimension Stacking. Dimension Stacking is used to represent the percentage share of each member from a selected dimension as part of the Waffle Chart.
23.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of the Additional Properties for the Waffle Chart. 
24.	In the area Dimension Stacking activate the property Enable Dimension Stacking (see Figure below). To use Dimension Stacking, you need to add a Data Source with at least one dimension in the Rows.

 .. figure:: _static/wf9.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Waffle Chart – Category Data 
 
25.	Set the property Select Measure to the option Sales Amount.
26.	With Dimension Stacking enabled you will then receive each dimension member listed and you can assign a color per dimension member (see Figure above).
27.	Navigate to the menu Application • Save.
28.	Select the menu Application • Execute Locally.
29.	Based on the property configured, you will be able to view the Waffle Chart with different colored boxes in  a 10 x 10 Matrix form representing the percentage level of the measure Sales Amount for each Product (see Figure below).

Risk Matrix Chart
-----------------
A Risk Matrix chart gives you the option to visualize your project risks along two dimension – Probability and Business Impact. In addition, you can add the visualization of a third measure to visualize the significance of the risk in form of a bubble. The Risk Matrix can be configured with different matrix sizes and you will be able to define the color coding for the different areas of the chart using the colors green, yellow and red.

*Sample Data Set*
 
How to use a Risk Matrix Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new Risk Matrix Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
You can follow the steps below to configure the Risk Matrix Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer. 
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows two measures – Probability and Impact - and one dimension Risk. 
3.	Add a Risk Matrix Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Risk Matrix Chart. 
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Risk Matrix Chart (see Figure below).  
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in the Additional Properties of the Risk Matrix Chart (see Figure below). 
8.	In the area Chart Settings you can configure the Risk Matrix Chart with X and Y Axis Measures. For our example, set the property Select X-Axis Measure to the measure Probability.
9.	Set the property Select Y-Axis Measure to the measure Impact. 
10.	Activate the property Enable Bubble Size in case you would like to represent the Significance of the risk by assigning a measure from the data source.
11.	When the property Enable Bubble Size is activated, you need to assign a measure to the property Size. For our example, the option is activated (see Figure below) and the measure Impact is assigned. 
12.	When the property Display Occurrences is activated, the number of risks in each of the matrix categories will be shown as a numeric value displayed in each of the squares.

    Category Data 

13.	You can configure the axis scale for the X-Axis and Y-Axis to be based on a Percentage assignment or an Absolute value assignment. When selecting the option “Percentage”, you can assign percentage values for the start and end values of each range of the axis. The assigned percentages will then calculate the actual start and end values for the ranges based on the assigned percentage values and the assigned measures.
14.	When selecting the option “Absolute”, you have the option to assign absolute start and end values for each range on the axis.
15.	For our example, set the property X-Axis and Y-Axis Range Type to the option “Absolute” (see below Figures).
16.	Based on the absolute values of the measure Probability and the measure Impact, the Risk Matrix is configured.
17.	You can change the text for the labels based on your choice. For our example, set the property Range 1 to the value from 0 to 1 (see below Figures). 
18.	Set the property Range 2 to the value from 1 to 2.
19.	Set the property Range 3 to the value from 2 to 3.
20.	Set the property Range 4 to the value from 3 to 4.
21.	Set the property Range 5 to the value from 4 to 5.

22.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data Label. Ensure that the property Enable Data Labels is activated (see Figure below).
23.	For our example, set the property Data Label Type to the option Dimension.
24.	You can also set the property Data Label Measure and the three different options for the Measure are

    •	X-Axis
    •	Y-Axis
    •	Z-Axis (Size)

    Category Appearance 

25.	Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart (see Figure below). In the area Matrix Color you can configure the size of the Risk Matrix chart. For our example, you can set the property Select Matrix Size to the option 5x5.
26.	After you configured the size of the Risk Matrix, you need to configure the Color Range. Based on the configured size of the Risk Matrix – in our example 5x5 – you will have to configure color codes for values from 1 to 25.
27.	For our example, the below Table shows the Color code and Range value for 5x5 Matrix (see Figure below)

================================ ============================= 
Color                                   Range Value
================================ ============================= 
Green	                                 0 - 10
Yellow	                                11 - 20
Red	                                    21 - 30

Calendar Heat Map Chart
-----------------------

The Calendar Heat Map Chart allows you to display the distribution of a
measure across a date / time based calendar heat map. The Calendar Heat
map can display up to two time dimensions.

    Calendar Heat Map

Data Source Requirements for a Calendar Heat Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimum data source requirement for a Calendar Heat Map Chart is a
data source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one measure in
the Columns. The dimension will have to be a date / time representation,
such as a calendar day, calendar month, week, year, etc.

How to use a Calendar Heat Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Calendar
Heat Map as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Calendar Heat Map Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows three measures – Number of Records, Key Figure
   1 and Key Figure 2 - and three dimensions Calendar Year, Calendar
   Month, and Timeseries Time.

3. Add a Calendar Heat Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Calendar Heat Map Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Calendar Heat Map Chart
   (see Figure below).

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in
   the Additional Properties of the Calendar Heat Map Chart (see Figure
   below).

 .. figure:: _static/ch2.png

    :alt: alternate text

    Category Data

8. For our example, in the area Chart Settings set the property Domain
   to the option Year. The other options are listed below

    -  Month

    -  Week

    -  Day

    -  Hour

The Domain of the Calendar Heat Map is the most outer time dimension and
the Sub Domain is the inner dimension of the Calendar Heat Map.

9.  Set the property Domain Range to the value 3 to display three domain
    values – in our example three years.

10. Set the property Sub Domain to the option Month.

11. Set the property Minimum and Maximum Date to the option Dynamic. By
    setting it to Dynamic, the maximum and minimum dates will be derived
    from the assigned data source.

12. Set the property Week Start to the option Monday.

13. Using the property Return Format you can specify the format for the
    return format as part of the scripting functions.

14. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    and to the area General Settings (see Figure below).

15. Set the property Chart Orientation to the option Horizontal.

16. Ensure that the property Enable Previous/Next Navigation is
    activated so that you will be able to navigate to the Calendar Heat
    Map.

17. Set the property Number of Previous/Next Steps to the value 1, so
    that each navigation step will move the Calendar Heat Map by one
    year.

    Category Appearance

18. Set the property Row Limit to the value 3, so that three rows of the
    Domain value – in our case year – will be shown (see Figure above).

19. Set the property Column Limit to the value 3 which shows three
    columns in a domain.

20. Set the property Cell Size to the value 15.

21. Set the property Cell Padding to the value 2 which adjusts the space
    between each cell in the domain.

22. Set the property Cell Radius to the value 1.

23. Set the property Domain Gutter to the value 10 which adjusts the
    space between each domain.

24. Set the property Domain Margin to the value 15.

25. Set the property Reading Order to the option Top to Bottom. The
    Reading Order is defining how the data is going to be displayed. For
    example, a Reading Order Top to Bottom will display the days of a
    month first from top to bottom and then the next set of days in the
    next column for the month.

26. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in
    the Additional Properties of the Calendar Heat Map Chart (see Figure
    below).

 .. figure:: _static/ch4.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Category Data Series

27. In the area Chart Settings, you can then select the dimensions that
    are available for the Calendar Heat Map and you can assign the
    format for each of the dimensions using the placeholders.

28. You can choose the measure from the property Select Measure that
    will be used to visualize the information. In our example, measure
    Number of Records.

29. Set the property Year to the format YYYY.

30. Set the property Month to the format MM.

31. Click Save to save the properties.

32. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties (see Figure below). In the area Color 
    Scheme you can configure the Color Scheme for the Calendar Heat Map
    Chart.

 .. figure:: _static/ch5.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Category Appearance

33. For our example, set the property Select Color Scheme to the option
    Custom.

34. Set the property No. of Color Buckets to the value 5 which shows 5
    buckets below the domains.

35. Set the property Choose Nature of data to the option Sequential.

36. Set the property Choose Color Scheme for the cell color based on
    your choice.

37. You will be able to view the Calendar Heat Map Chart based on the
    configured properties (see Figure below).

    Sample Sunburst Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Sunburst Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mandatory data source requirement for a Sunburst Chart is one or
more dimensions with at least one measure. The dimension can have
different levels of Hierarchies.

How to use the Sunburst Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Sunburst
Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project. For these steps we assume we have a data source with one
Dimension having two hierarchy levels and one Measure, similar to the
Table shown below.

*Sample Data*

You can follow the steps below to configure the Sunburst Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows one measure – Total Expenses and one Dimension
   – Cost Element with two levels of Hierarchy as shown in the above
   table.

3. Add a Sunburst Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Sunburst Chart.

5. The Sunburst Chart will plot the information from the assigned data
   source (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/sbc2.png

    Sunburst Chart

The above Figure shows the basic Sunburst Chart for one measure – Total
Expenses and one dimension - Cost Element with two levels of Hierarchy
as shown in the above Table. Here you can observe that the first level of
Hierarchy for the Dimension Cost Element shows the Measure value for
Main Expenses in the inner circle layer “1” (see Figure above). The 
second level of Hierarchy for the Dimension Cost Element shows the
Measure values for Apparel, Electronics, Stationery and Miscellaneous in
the next circle layer “2” and the Measure values for all the Dimension
members under the second level Hierarchy (Apparel, Electronics,
Stationery and Miscellaneous) are shown in the circle layer “3”. You can
use now the Additional Properties to customize the layout and look and
feel.

Additional Properties of Sunburst Chart 
---------------------------------------

The Additional Properties of the Sunburst Chart are shown as part of the
common set of Additional Properties in :ref:`Section: Common Properties <CommonProperties>`.

Scripting Functions for Sunburst Chart 
--------------------------------------

All supported scripting functions for the Sunburst Chart are listed as
part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.

Performance Charts
******************
Other useful charts that do not fall under the categories mentioned previously, are grouped into the Performance Charts category. The performance charts allow several different measures to be compared against the benchmark in the same chart. In this category you will find the details of the following chart types:

•	Bullet Chart
•	Fixed Column Chart
•	Box Plot Chart

Bullet Chart
------------
The Bullet chart (see Figure below) is an enhanced bar/column chart where the performance measure is plotted against a comparison measure, which is highlighted as a marker over the performance measure. The background of the chart is also filled with a color code, which shows the qualitative range for the performance measure.

Deviation Display in Bullet Chart
---------------------------------
In the Additional Properties of the Bullet Chart in the category Data and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the Deviation Display Bar for the Bullet Chart to view the difference value between the Performance Measure and the Comparison Measure.  
For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the Deviation Display Bar in the Bullet Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source has a dimension Item Category and three measures – Order Quantity, Order Cost and Order Amount.
3.	Add a Bullet Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio / SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Bullet Chart.
5.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Bullet Chart. 
6.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional Properties.
7.	In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series (see Figure below).

Data Source Requirements for a Bullet Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum requirements for the data source for a Bullet Chart is a data source with at least one dimension and two measures. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Bullet Chart.
You can follow these rules in regards to the data structure for a Bullet Chart:

•	Dimensions in the Rows will be used to generate a Bullet Chart per element in the Rows.
•	You will need at least two measures for the Performance Measure as well as for at least one Qualitative Range measure.
•	All three Qualitative Ranges can be based on measure values or you can base them on a percentage value calculation based on a single measure value.

How to use the Bullet Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Bullet Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with the following elements:

•	Dimension Product in the Rows
•	Measure Net Value in the Columns
•	Measure Profit in the Columns
•	Measure Cost in the Columns

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Bullet Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Bullet Chart.

    •	Comparison Measure 1: Here you can assign the measure that will be used as first comparison value.
    •	Comparison Measure 2: Here you can assign the measure that will be used as second comparison value.
    •	Qualitative Range Measure 1: Here you can assign the measure that will be used end value for the first Qualitative Range.
    •	Qualitative Range Measure 2: Here you can assign the measure that will be used end value for the second Qualitative Range.
    •	Qualitative Range Measure 3: Here you can assign the measure that will be used end value for the third Qualitative Range.
    •	Percentage Qualitative Range 1: This option allows to enter a percentage value for the calculation of the Qualitative Range 1 based on a single measure.
    •	Percentage Qualitative Range 3: This option allows to enter a percentage value for the calculation of the Qualitative Range 3 based on a single measure.

11.	You have three options to define the Qualitative Ranges for the Bullet Chart:

    •	Option 1: You use the three settings and assign three individual measures to each of the Qualitative Ranges. This option allows to leverage measures from the data source and therefore the ranges stay dynamic.
    •	Option 2: You use the individual sliders in the Qualitative Ranges area of the category Data (see Figure below). This option allows you to define Qualitative Ranges for each dimension member.
    •	Option 3: You assign one measure to the Qualitative Ranges and use percentage values for the other two Qualitative Ranges.

Example for Option 3:
If "Measure 1" is specified for the Qualitative Range 2, and 40 %  is being entered as value for the Percentage Qualitative Range 1 and 70 % is being entered as value for the for Percentage Qualitative Range 3, then the Qualitative Ranges 1 and 3 will be calculated based on the value of “Measure 1” and the assigned percentage values.

Additional Properties of the Bullet Chart
-----------------------------------------
In :ref:`Section: Additional Properties Sheet <AdditionalProperties>` we discussed the common set of Additional Properties for all charts and in :ref:`Section: Category General <AdditionalProperties1>` we outlined the Additional Properties for the X-Axis and the Y-Axis. In this section we will outline the Additional Properties that are specific to the Bullet Chart.

Fixed Column Chart
------------------
The Fixed Column Chart (see Figure below) allows you to place measure values on top of each other – similar to a Bullet Chart shows a Performance Measure and the Qualitative Ranges in the background.

    Fixed Column Placement Chart

The above Figure shows a Fixed Column Chart visualizing four measures for three categories and two measures are always placed together. 

Data Source Requirements for a Fixed Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The minimum requirements for the data source for a Fixed Column Chart is a data source with at least one dimension in the Rows and two measures in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Fixed Column Chart.
You can follow these rules in regards to the data structure for a Fixed Column Chart:

•	The first measure in the Columns will be placed into the background and will be visualized by the wider bar / column.
•	The second measure in the Columns will be placed into the front of the first measure and will be visualized by the thinner bar / column inside of the bar / column of the first measure.

How to use the Fixed Column Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Fixed Column Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with the following elements:

•	Dimension Product in the Rows
•	Measure Net Value in the Columns
•	Measure Profit in the Columns
•	Measure Cost in the Columns

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Fixed Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart.

5.	The chart will use the first measure in the column and display it as the column in the back – in our example Net Value – and the second measure will be placed inside – in our example Profit (see Figure above).
 
Additional Properties of the Fixed Column Chart
-----------------------------------------------
In :ref:`Section: Additional Properties Sheet <AdditionalProperties>` we discussed the common set of Additional Properties for all charts and in :ref:`Section: Category General <AdditionalProperties1>` we outlined the Additional Properties for the X-Axis and the Y-Axis. In this section we will outline the Additional Properties that are specific to the Fixed Column Chart.

Scripting Functions for the Fixed Column Chart
----------------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Fixed Column Chart are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.

Box Plot Chart
--------------
A box plot chart is a standardized and convenient way of displaying the distribution of data based on their quartiles: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum (see Figure below).

    Box Plot Chart Metrics

Data Source Requirements for a Box Plot Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Box Plot Chart has two main options to leverage the information from the assigned data source.
- You can decide to assign the data source and let the chart calculate the different values - such as the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile – based on all measures in the assigned data source.
- You can assign individual measures from the data source to each of the needed values for a Box Plot chart.

Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of the Additional Properties for the Box Plot Chart. In the area Chart Settings you can find the area Assign Measures manually (see Figure below). 

 .. figure:: _static/bx2.png

    Category Data 

The above Figure shows the option to calculate the values as part of the chart by activating the option Calculate Values based on Data Source, or to assign measures from the data source to each of the necessary values for the Box Plot Chart. 

How to use the Box Plot Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Box Plot Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with the following elements:

•	Dimension with six members in the Rows
•	24 Measures representing measurement values per dimension member

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined previously.
3.	Add a Box Plot Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the chart (see Figure below).

5.	By default, the Box Plot Chart will leverage all the data and calculate the values for the chart – as shown in the above Figure. 
6.	Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Box Plot Chart.
7.	In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the Additional Properties.
8.	In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart (see Figure below).

    Category Data 

9.	In the area General Settings you can configure the color assignment for the different parts of the Box Plot chart.
10.	Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of the Additional Properties for the Box Plot Chart (Figure below). In the area Chart Settings you can find the area Assign Measures manually.

    Box Plot Measure Assignment

11.	Here you can decide if the Box Plot Chart should calculate the values based on the data source by enabling the option Calculate Values based on Data Source, or you can assign individual measures to the different parts of a Box Plot Chart.
 
Additional Properties of the Box Plot Chart

Sankey Chart
************

Sankey Chart – Overview
-----------------------
Sankey Chart is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another. The things being connected are called nodes otherwise named as “dimensions” and the connections are called links otherwise named as “measures”.  Sankey charts are typically used to visualize energy or material or cost transfers between processes.

    :alt: alternate text

    Sample Sankey Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Sankey Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mandatory data source requirement for a Sankey Chart are two dimensions and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Sankey Chart. 

How to use the Sankey Chart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Sankey Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For these steps we assume we have a data source, similar to the Table shown below.

+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| From Warehouse | To Warehouse | Materials Count |
+================+==============+=================+
| Warehouse A    | Warehouse B  | 500             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse A    | Warehouse C  | 250             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse B    | Warehouse C  | 700             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse B    | Warehouse D  | 350             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse C    | Warehouse E  | 315             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse C    | Warehouse F  | 320             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+

*Sample Data*
 
You can follow the steps below to configure the Sankey Chart:

1.	Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.
2.	Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that our data source shows one measure – Materials Count and two Dimensions – From Warehouse and To Warehouse.
3.	Add a Sankey Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.
4.	Assign the data source to the Sankey Chart.
5.	The Sankey Chart will plot the information from the assigned data source (see Figure below).

Scripting Functions for Parallel Coordinates Chart  
--------------------------------------------------
All supported scripting functions for the Parallel Coordinates Chart are listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in :ref:`Section: Common Scripting Functions <Scripting>`.  


Chart Selector and Chart Container 
**********************************
The Chart Selector is a run time component where you will be able to select a chart from a defined list of available VBX Charts (see Figure below) and update a Chart Container based on the selection. The Chart Selector is working in combination with the Chart Container component. By using the Chart Selector and Chart Container component, you can switch between different chart types without having to write any scripting code.

The available chart families are:

•	Bar / Column Charts 
•	Line Charts 
•	Pie Charts 
•	Combination Charts
•	Scatter Charts 
•	Other Charts

    Additional Properties

5.	In the Additional Properties of the Chart Selector you can configure the following options:

    - **Available Containers:** Here you can select a Chart Container from all the available Chart Container components used in your dashboard. In case the list is shown empty, you can use the Refresh option to update the list
    - **Default Chart Type:** Here you can set the default chart that will be selected when the dashboard is executed.
    - **On Select:** By navigating to the category Scripting you can enable the interaction with the component by writing script. The On Select event is triggered when you select a value in the component.
    - **Chart Configuration:** Here you can select which charts should be available as part of the Chart Selector. You can remove charts with a simple drag and drop navigation by adding charts to the Dropped Charts list on the right hand side. You also have the option to either select or unselect a complete chart family by enabling or disabling the check-box in the header for each chart family.

6.	Now navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in the Additional Properties of the Chart Container (see Figure below).
